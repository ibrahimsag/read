A straight-line said to touch a circle is any (straight-line) which, meeting the circle and being produced, does not cut the circle.\n\n3. Circles said to touch one another are any (circles) which, meeting one another, do not cut one another.\n\n4. In a circle, straight-lines are said to be equally far from the center when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the center are equal.\n\n5. And (that straight-line) is said to be further (from the center) on which the greater perpendicular falls (from the center).\n\n6. A segment of a circle is the figure contained by a straight-line and a circumference of a circle.\n\n7. And the angle of a segment is that contained by a straight-line and a circumference of a circle.\n\n8. And the angle in a segment is the angle contained by the joined straight-lines, when any point is taken on the circumference of a segment, and straight-lines are joined from it to the ends of the straight-line which is the base of the segment.\n\n9. And when the straight-lines containing an angle cut off some circumference, the angle is said to stand upon that (circumference).\n\n10. And a sector of a circle is the figure contained by the straight-lines surrounding an angle, and the circumference cut off by them, when the angle is constructed at the center of a circle.\n\n11. Similar segments of circles are those accepting equal angles, or in which the angles are equal to one another.\n",

    "prose": "To find the center of a given circle.\n\nLet {ABC circle F} be the given circle.\nSo it is required to find the center of circle {ABC circle F}.\n\nLet some straight-line {AB line} have been drawn through ({ABC circle F}), at random, and let ({AB line}) have been cut in half at point {D point} [Prop. 1.9].\nAnd let {DC line} have been drawn from {D point}, at right-angles to {AB line} [Prop. 1.11].\nAnd let ({CD line}) have been drawn through to {E point} (as {CE line}).\nAnd let {CE line} have been cut in half at {F point} [Prop. 1.9].\nI say that (point) {F point} is the center of the [circle] {ABC circle F}.\n\nFor (if) not then, if possible, let {G point} (be the center of the circle), and let {GA line}, {GD line}, and {GB line} have been joined.\nAnd since {AD line} is equal to {DB line}, and {DG line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AD line}, {DG line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BD line}, {DG line}, respectively.\nAnd the base {GA line} is equal to the base {GB line}.\nFor (they are both) radii.\nThus, angle {ADG angle} is equal to angle {GDB angle} [Prop. 1.8].\nAnd when a straight-line stood upon (another) straight-line make adjacent angles (which are) equal to one another, each of the equal angles is a right-angle [Def. 1.10].\nThus, {GDB angle} is a right-angle.\nAnd {FDB angle} is also a right-angle.\nThus, {FDB angle} (is) equal to {GDB angle}, the greater to the lesser.\nThe very thing is impossible.\nThus, (point) {G point} is not the center of the circle {ABC circle F}.\nSo, similarly, we can show that neither is any other (point) except {F point}.\n\nThus, point {F point} is the center of the [circle] {ABC circle F}.\n\nCorollary\n\nSo, from this, (it is) manifest that if any straight-line in a circle cuts any (other) straight-line in half, and at right-angles, then the center of the circle is on the former (straight-line).\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.\n",

    "prose": "If some point is taken outside a circle, and some straight-lines are drawn from the point to the (circumference of the) circle, one of which (passes) through the center, the remainder (being) random, then for the straight-lines radiating towards the concave (part of the) circumference, the greatest is that (passing) through the center.\nFor the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the (straight-line) through the center is always greater than one further away.\nFor the straight-lines radiating towards the convex (part of the) circumference, the least is that between the point and the diameter.\nFor the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the least (straight-line) is always less than one further away.\nAnd only two equal (straight-lines) will radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, (one) on each (side) of the least (straight-line).\n\nLet {ABC circle M} be a circle, and let some point {D point} have been taken outside {ABC circle M}, and from it let some straight-lines, {DA line}, {DE line}, {DF line}, and {DC line}, have been drawn through (the circle), and let {DA line} be through the center.\nI say that for the straight-lines radiating towards the concave (part of the) circumference, {AEFC arc M}, the greatest is the one (passing) through the center, (namely) {AD line}, and (that) {DE line} (is) greater than {DF line}, and {DF line} than {DC line}.\nFor the straight-lines radiating towards the convex (part of the) circumference, {HLKG arc M}, the least is the one between the point and the diameter {AG line}, (namely) {DG line}, and a (straight-line) nearer to the least (straight-line) {DG line} is always less than one farther away, (so that) {DK line} (is less) than {DL line}, and {DL line} than than {DH line}.\n\nFor let the center of the circle have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let it be (at point) {M point} [Prop. 3.1].\nAnd let {ME line}, {MF line}, {MC line}, {MK line}, {ML line}, and {MH line} have been joined.\nAnd since {AM line} is equal to {EM line}, let {MD line} have been added to both.\nThus, {AD line} is equal to {EM line} and {MD line}.\nBut, {EM line} and {MD line} is greater than {ED line} [Prop. 1.20].\nThus, {AD line} is also greater than {ED line}.\nAgain, since {ME line} is equal to {MF line}, and {MD line} (is) common, the (straight-lines) {EM line}, {MD line} are thus equal to {FM line}, {MD line}.\nAnd angle {EMD angle} is greater than angle {FMD angle}.\nThus, the base {ED line} is greater than the base {FD line} [Prop. 1.24].\nSo, similarly, we can show that {FD line} is also greater than {CD line}.\nThus, {AD line} (is) the greatest (straight-line), and {DE line} (is) greater than {DF line}, and {DF line} than {DC line}.\n\nAnd since {MK line} and {KD line} is greater than {MD line} [Prop. 1.20], and {MG line} (is) equal to {MK line}, the remainder {KD line} is thus greater than the remainder {GD line}.\nSo {GD line} is less than {KD line}.\nAnd since in triangle {MLD polygon}, the two internal straight-lines {MK line} and {KD line} were constructed on one of the sides, {MD line}, then {MK line} and {KD line} are thus less than {ML line} and {LD line} [Prop. 1.21].\nAnd {MK line} (is) equal to {ML line}.\nThus, the remainder {DK line} is less than the remainder {DL line}.\nSo, similarly, we can show that {DL line} is also less than {DH line}.\nThus, {DG line} (is) the least (straight-line), and {DK line} (is) less than {DL line}, and {DL line} than {DH line}.\n\nI also say that only two equal (straight-lines) will radiate from point {D point} towards (the circumference of) the circle, (one) on each (side) on the least (straight-line), {DG line}.\nLet the angle {DMB angle}, equal to angle {KMD angle}, have been constructed on the straight-line {MD line}, at the point {M point} on it [Prop. 1.23], and let {DB line} have been joined.\nAnd since {MK line} is equal to {MB line}, and {MD line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {KM line}, {MD line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BM line}, {MD line}, respectively.\nAnd angle {KMD angle} (is) equal to angle {BMD angle}.\nThus, the base {DK line} is equal to the base {DB line} [Prop. 1.4].\n[So] I say that another (straight-line) equal to {DK line} will not radiate towards the (circumference of the) circle from point {D point}.\nFor, if possible, let (such a straight-line) radiate, and let it be {DN line}.\nTherefore, since {DK line} is equal to {DN line}, but {DK line} is equal to {DB line}, then {DB line} is thus also equal to {DN line}, (so that) a (straight-line) nearer to the least (straight-line) {DG line} [is] equal to one further away.\nThe very thing was shown (to be) impossible.\nThus, not more than two equal (straight-lines) will radiate towards (the circumference of) circle {ABC circle M} from point {D point}, (one) on each side of the least (straight-line) {DG line}.\n\nThus, if some point is taken outside a circle, and some straight-lines are drawn from the point to the (circumference of the) circle, one of which (passes) through the center, the remainder (being) random, then for the straight-lines radiating towards the concave (part of the) circumference, the greatest is that (passing) through the center.\nFor the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the (straight-line) through the center is always greater than one further away.\nFor the straight-lines radiating towards the convex (part of the) circumference, the least is that between the point and the diameter.\nFor the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the least (straight-line) is always less than one further away.\nAnd only two equal (straight-lines) will radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, (one) on each (side) of the least (straight-line).\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "To draw a segment of a circle, accepting an angle equal to a given rectilinear angle, on a given straight-line.\n\nLet {AB line} be the given straight-line, and {C given} the given rectilinear angle.\nSo it is required to draw a segment of a circle, accepting an angle equal to {C given}, on the given straight-line {AB line}.\n\nSo the [angle] {C given} is surely either acute, a right-angle, or obtuse.\n{figure 1}First of all, let it be acute.\nAnd, as in the first diagram (from the left), let (angle) {BAD angle}, equal to angle {C given}, have been constructed on the straight-line {AB line}, at the point {A point} (on it) [Prop. 1.23].\nThus, {BAD angle} is also acute.\nLet {AE line} have been drawn, at right-angles to {DA line} [Prop. 1.11].  \nAnd let {AB line} have been cut in half at {F point} [Prop. 1.10].\nAnd let {FG line} have been drawn from point {F point}, at right-angles to {AB line} [Prop. 1.11].\nAnd let {GB line} have been joined.\n\nAnd since {AF line} is equal to {FB line}, and {FG line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AF line}, {FG line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BF line}, {FG line} (respectively).\nAnd angle {AFG angle} (is) equal to [angle] {BFG angle}.\nThus, the base {AG line} is equal to the base {BG line} [Prop. 1.4].\nThus, the circle drawn with center {G point}, and radius {GA line}, will also go through {B point} (as well as {A point}).\nLet it have been drawn, and let it be (denoted) {ABE circle G}.\nAnd let {EB line} have been joined.\nTherefore, since {AD line} is at the extremity of diameter {AE line}, (namely, point) {A point}, at right-angles to {AE line}, the (straight-line) {AD line} thus touches the circle {ABE circle G} [Prop. 3.16 corr.].\nTherefore, since some straight-line {AD line} touches the circle {ABE circle G}, and some (other) straight-line {AB line} has been drawn across from the point of contact {A point} into circle {ABE circle G}, angle {DAB angle} is thus equal to the angle {AEB angle} in the alternate segment of the circle [Prop. 3.32].\nBut, {DAB angle} is equal to {C given}.\nThus, angle {C given} is also equal to {AEB angle}.\n\nThus, a segment {AEB arc G} of a circle, accepting the angle {AEB angle} (which is) equal to the given (angle) {C given}, has been drawn on the given straight-line {AB line}.\n\n{figure 2}And so let {C given} be a right-angle.\nAnd let it again be necessary to draw a segment of a circle on {AB line}, accepting an angle equal to the right-[angle] {C given}.\nLet the (angle) {BAD angle} [again] have been constructed, equal to the right-angle {C given} [Prop. 1.23], as in the second diagram (from the left).\nAnd let {AB line} have been cut in half at {F point} [Prop. 1.10].\nAnd let the circle {AEB circle F} have been drawn with center {F point}, and radius either {FA line} or {FB line}.\n\nThus, the straight-line {AD line} touches the circle {ABE circle F}, on account of the angle at {A point} being a right-angle [Prop. 3.16 corr.].\nAnd angle {BAD angle} is equal to the angle in segment {AEB arcc F}.\nFor (the latter angle), being in a semi-circle, is also a right-angle [Prop. 3.31].\nBut, {BAD angle} is also equal to {C given}.\nThus, the (angle) in (segment) {AEB angle} is also equal to {C given}.\n\nThus, a segment {AEB arcc F} of a circle, accepting an angle equal to {C given}, has again been drawn on {AB line}.\n\n{figure 3}And so let (angle) {C given} be obtuse.\nAnd let (angle) {BAD angle}, equal to ({C given}), have been constructed on the straight-line {AB line}, at the point {A point} (on it) [Prop. 1.23], as in the third diagram (from the left).\nAnd let {AE line} have been drawn, at right-angles to {AD line} [Prop. 1.11].\nAnd let {AB line} have again been cut in half at {F point} [Prop. 1.10].\nAnd let {FG line} have been drawn, at right-angles to {AB line} [Prop. 1.10].\nAnd let {GB line} have been joined.\n\nAnd again, since {AF line} is equal to {FB line}, and {FG line} (is) common, the two (straight-lines) {AF line}, {FG line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BF line}, {FG line} (respectively).\nAnd angle {AFG angle} (is) equal to angle {BFG angle}.\nThus, the base {AG line} is equal to the base {BG line} [Prop. 1.4].\nThus, a circle of center {G point}, and radius {GA line}, being drawn, will also go through {B point} (as well as {A point}).\nLet it go like {AEB circle G} (in the third diagram from the left).\nAnd since {AD line} is at right-angles to the diameter {AE line}, at its extremity, {AD line} thus touches circle {AEB circle G} [Prop. 3.16 corr.].\nAnd {AB line} has been drawn across (the circle) from the point of contact {A point}.\nThus, angle {BAD angle} is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment {AHB arc G} of the circle [Prop. 3.32].\nBut, angle {BAD angle} is equal to {C given}.\nThus, the angle in segment {AHB arc G} is also equal to {C given}.\n\nThus, a segment {AHB arc G} of a circle, accepting an angle equal to {C given}, has been drawn on the given straight-line {AB line}.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.\n",
