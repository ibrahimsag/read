(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n\nLemma\n\nAnd it can be shown that double {AC line} (i.e., {DC line}) is greater than {BC line}, as follows.\n\nFor if (double {AC line} is) not (greater than {BC line}), if possible, let {BC line} be double {CA line}.\nThus, the (square) on {BC line} (is) four times the (square) on {CA line}.\nThus, the (sum of) the (squares) on {BC line} and {CA line} (is) five times the (square) on {CA line}.\nAnd the (square) on {BA line} was assumed (to be) five times the (square) on {CA line}.\nThus, the (square) on {BA line} is equal to the (sum of) the (squares) on {BC line} and {CA line}.\nThe very thing (is) impossible [Prop. 2.4].\nThus, {CB line} is not double {AC line}.\nSo, similarly, we can show that a (straight-line) less than {CB line} is not double {AC line} either.\nFor (in this case) the absurdity is much [greater].\n\nThus, double {AC line} is greater than {CB line}.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "If an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a circle which has a rational diameter then the side of the pentagon is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.\n\nFor let the equilateral pentagon {ABCDE polygon} have been inscribed in the circle {ABCDE circle F} which has a rational diameter.\nI say that the side of pentagon [{ABCDE polygon}] is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.\n\nFor let the center of the circle, point {F point}, have been found [Prop. 3.1].\nAnd let {AF line} and {FB line} have been joined.\nAnd let them have been drawn across to points {G point} and {H point} (respectively).\nAnd let {AC line} have been joined.\nAnd let {FK line} made (equal) to the fourth part of {AF line}.\nAnd {AF line} (is) rational.\n{FK line} (is) thus also rational.\nAnd {BF line} is also rational.\nThus, the whole of {BK line} is rational.\nAnd since circumference {ACG arcc F} is equal to circumference {ADG arc F}, of which {ABC arcc F} is equal to {AED arc F}, the remainder {CG arcc F} is thus equal to the remainder {GD arcc F}.\nAnd if we join {AD line} then the angles at {L point} are inferred (to be) right-angles, and {CD line} (is inferred to be) double {CL line} [Prop. 1.4].\nSo, for the same (reasons), the (angles) at {M point} are also right-angles, and {AC line} (is) double {CM line}.\nTherefore, since angle {ALC angle} (is) equal to {AMF angle}, and (angle) {LAC angle} (is) common to the two triangles {ACL polygon} and {AMF polygon}, the remaining (angle) {ACL angle} is thus equal to the remaining (angle) {MFA angle} [Prop. 1.32].\nThus, triangle {ACL polygon} is equiangular to triangle {AMF polygon}.\nThus, proportionally, as {LC line} (is) to {CA line}, so {MF line} (is) to {FA line} [Prop. 6.4].\nAnd (we can take) the doubles of the leading (magnitudes).\nThus, as double {LC line} (is) to {CA line}, so double {MF line} (is) to {FA line}.\nAnd as double {MF line} (is) to {FA line}, so {MF line} (is) to half of {FA line}.\nAnd, thus, as double {LC line} (is) to {CA line}, so {MF line} (is) to half of {FA line}.\nAnd (we can take) the halves of the following (magnitudes).\nThus, as double {LC line} (is) to half of {CA line}, so {MF line} (is) to the fourth of {FA line}.\nAnd {DC line} is double {LC line}, and {CM line} half of {CA line}, and {FK line} the fourth part of {FA line}.\nThus, as {DC line} is to {CM line}, so {MF line} (is) to {FK line}.\nVia composition, as the sum of DCM (i.e., {DC line} and {CM line}) (is) to {CM line}, so {MK line} (is) to {KF line} [Prop. 5.18].\nAnd, thus, as the (square) on the sum of {DC line} and {CM line} (is) to the (square) on {CM line}, so the (square) on {MK line} (is) to the (square) on {KF line}.\nAnd since the greater piece of a (straight-line) subtending two sides of a pentagon, such as {AC line}, (which is) cut in extreme and mean ratio is equal to the side of the pentagon [Prop. 13.8] --- that is to say, to {DC line} --- and the square on the greater piece added to half of the whole is five times the (square) on half of the whole [Prop. 13.1], and {CM line} (is) half of the whole, {AC line}, thus the (square) on {DC line} and {CM line}, (taken) as one, is five times the (square) on {CM line}.\nAnd the (square) on {DC line} and {CM line}, (taken) as one, (is) to the (square) on {CM line}, so the (square) on {MK line} was shown (to be) to the (square) on {KF line}.\nThus, the (square) on {MK line} (is) five times the (square) on {KF line}.\nAnd the square on {KF line} (is) rational.\nFor the diameter (is) rational.\nThus, the (square) on {MK line} (is) also rational.\nThus, {MK line} is rational [in square only].\nAnd since {BF line} is four times {FK line}, {BK line} is thus five times {KF line}.\nThus, the (square) on {BK line} (is) twenty-five times the (square) on {KF line}.\nAnd the (square) on {MK line} (is) five times the square on {KF line}.\nThus, the (square) on {BK line} (is) five times the (square) on {KM line}.\nThus, the (square) on {BK line} does not have to the (square) on {KM line} the ratio which a square number (has) to a square number.\nThus, {BK line} is incommensurable in length with {KM line} [Prop. 10.9].\nAnd each of them is a rational (straight-line).\nThus, {BK line} and {KM line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nAnd if from a rational (straight-line) a rational (straight-line) is subtracted, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, then the remainder is that irrational (straight-line called) an apotome [Prop. 10.73].\nThus, {MB line} is an apotome, and {MK line} its attachment.\nSo, I say that (it is) also a fourth (apotome).\nSo, let the (square) on {N given} be (made) equal to that (magnitude) by which the (square) on {BK line} is greater than the (square) on {KM line}.\nThus, the square on {BK line} is greater than the (square) on {KM line} by the (square) on {N given}.\nAnd since {KF line} is commensurable (in length) with {FB line} then, via composition, {KB line} is also commensurable (in length) with {FB line} [Prop. 10.15].\nBut, {BF line} is commensurable (in length) with {BH line}.\nThus, {BK line} is also commensurable (in length) with {BH line} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd since the (square) on {BK line} is five times the (square) on {KM line}, the (square) on {BK line} thus has to the (square) on {KM line} the ratio which 5 (has) to one.\nThus, via conversion, the (square) on {BK line} has to the (square) on {N given} the ratio which 5 (has) to 4 [Prop. 5.19 corr.], which is not (that) of a square (number) to a square (number).\n{BK line} is thus incommensurable (in length) with {N given} [Prop. 10.9].\nThus, the square on {BK line} is greater than the (square) on {KM line} by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({BK line}).\nTherefore, since the square on the whole, {BK line}, is greater than the (square) on the attachment, {KM line}, by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({BK line}), and the whole, {BK line}, is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {BH line}, {MB line} is thus a fourth apotome [Def. 10.14].\nAnd the rectangle contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fourth apotome is irrational, and its square-root is that irrational (straight-line) called minor [Prop. 10.94].\nAnd the square on {AB line} is the rectangle contained by {HB line} and {BM line}, on account of joining {AH line}, (so that) triangle {ABH polygon} becomes equiangular with triangle {ABM polygon} [Prop. 6.8], and (proportionally) as {HB line} is to {BA line}, so {AB line} (is) to {BM line}.\n\nThus, the side {AB line} of the pentagon is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "id": "13.13",
    "prose": "To construct a (regular) pyramid (i.e., a tetrahedron), and to enclose (it) in a given sphere, and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the (square) on the side of the pyramid.\n\nLet the diameter {AB line} of the given sphere be laid out, and let it have been cut at point {C point} such that {AC line} is double {CB line} [Prop. 6.10].\nAnd let the semi-circle {ADB arc O} have been drawn on {AB line}.\nAnd let {CD line} have been drawn from point {C point} at right-angles to {AB line}.\nAnd let {DA line} have been joined.\nAnd let the circle {EFG given} be laid down having a radius equal to {DC line}, and let the equilateral triangle {EFG polygon} have been inscribed in circle {EFG given} [Prop. 4.2].\nAnd let the center of the circle, point {H point}, have been found [Prop. 3.1].\nAnd let {EH line}, {HF line}, and {HG line} have been joined.\nAnd let {HK line} have been set up, at point {H point}, at right-angles to the plane of circle {EFG given} [Prop. 11.12].\nAnd let {HK line}, equal to the straight-line {AC line}, have been cut off from {HK line}.\nAnd let {KE line}, {KF line}, and {KG line} have been joined.\nAnd since {KH line} is at right-angles to the plane of circle {EFG given}, it will thus also make right-angles with all of the straight-lines joining it (which are) also in the plane of circle {EFG given} [Def. 11.3].\nAnd {HE line}, {HF line}, and {HG line} each join it.\nThus, {HK line} is at right-angles to each of {HE line}, {HF line}, and {HG line}.\nAnd since {AC line} is equal to {HK line}, and {CD line} to {HE line}, and they contain right-angles, the base {DA line} is thus equal to the base {KE line} [Prop. 1.4].\nSo, for the same (reasons), {KF line} and {KG line} is each equal to {DA line}.\nThus, the three (straight-lines) {KE line}, {KF line}, and {KG line} are equal to one another.\nAnd since {AC line} is double {CB line}, {AB line} (is) thus triple {BC line}.\nAnd as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so the (square) on {AD line} (is) to the (square) on {DC line}, as will be shown later [see lemma].\nThus, the (square) on {AD line} (is) three times the (square) on {DC line}.\nAnd the (square) on {FE line} is also three times the (square) on {EH line} [Prop. 13.12], and {DC line} is equal to {EH line}.\nThus, {DA line} (is) also equal to {EF line}.\nBut, {DA line} was shown (to be) equal to each of {KE line}, {KF line}, and {KG line}.\nThus, {EF line}, {FG line}, and {GE line} are equal to {KE line}, {KF line}, and {KG line}, respectively.\nThus, the four triangles {EFG polygon}, {KEF polygon}, {KFG polygon}, and {KEG polygon} are equilateral.\nThus, a pyramid, whose base is triangle {EFG polygon}, and apex the point {K point}, has been constructed from four equilateral triangles.\n\nSo, it is also necessary to enclose it in the given sphere, and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the (square) on the side of the pyramid.\n\nFor let the straight-line {HL line} have been produced in a straight-line with {KH line}, and let {HL line} be made equal to {CB line}.\nAnd since as {AC line} (is) to {CD line}, so {CD line} (is) to {CB line} [Prop. 6.8 corr.], and {AC line} (is) equal to {KH line}, and {CD line} to {HE line}, and {CB line} to {HL line}, thus as {KH line} is to {HE line}, so {EH line} (is) to {HL line}.\nThus, the (rectangle contained) by {KH line} and {HL line} is equal to the (square) on {EH line} [Prop. 6.17].\nAnd each of the angles {KHE angle} and {EHL angle} is a right-angle.\nThus, the semi-circle drawn on {KL line} will also pass through {E point} [inasmuch as if we join {EL line} then the angle {LEK angle} becomes a right-angle, on account of triangle {ELK polygon} becoming equiangular to each of the triangles {ELH polygon} and {EHK polygon} [Props. 6.8, 3.31] ].\nSo, if {KL line} remains (fixed), and the semi-circle is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, it will also pass through points {F point} and {G point}, (because) if {FL line} and {LG line} are joined, the angles at {F point} and {G point} will similarly become right-angles.\nAnd the pyramid will have been enclosed by the given sphere.\nFor the diameter, {KL line}, of the sphere is equal to the diameter, {AB line}, of the given sphere— inasmuch as {KH line} was made equal to {AC line}, and {HL line} to {CB line}.\n\nSo, I say that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the (square) on the side of the pyramid.\n\nFor since {AC line} is double {CB line}, {AB line} is thus triple {BC line}.\nThus, via conversion, {BA line} is one and a half times {AC line}.\nAnd as {BA line} (is) to {AC line}, so the (square) on {BA line} (is) to the (square) on {AD line} [inasmuch as if {DB line} is joined then as {BA line} is to {AD line}, so {DA line} (is) to {AC line}, on account of the similarity of triangles {DAB polygon} and {DAC polygon}.\nAnd as the first is to the third (of four proportional magnitudes), so the (square) on the first (is) to the (square) on the second.] Thus, the (square) on {BA line} (is) also one and a half times the (square) on {AD line}.\nAnd {BA line} is the diameter of the given sphere, and {AD line} (is) equal to the side of the pyramid.\n\nThus, the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the (square) on the side of the pyramid.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "To construct an octahedron, and to enclose (it) in a (given) sphere, like in the preceding (proposition), and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double the (square) on the side of the octahedron.\n\nLet the diameter {AB line} of the given sphere be laid out, and let it have been cut in half at {C point}.\nAnd let the semi-circle {ADB arc C} have been drawn on {AB line}.\nAnd let {CD line} be drawn from {C point} at right-angles to {AB line}.\nAnd let {DB line} have been joined.\nAnd let the square {EFGH polygon}, having each of its sides equal to {DB line}, be laid out.\nAnd let {HF line} and {EG line} have been joined.\nAnd let the straight-line {KL line} have been set up, at point {K point}, at right-angles to the plane of square {EFGH polygon} [Prop. 11.12].\nAnd let it have been drawn across on the other side of the plane, like {KM line}.\nAnd let {KL line} and {KM line}, equal to one of {EK line}, {FK line}, {GK line}, and {HK line}, have been cut off from {KL line} and {KM line}, respectively.\nAnd let {LE line}, {LF line}, {LG line}, {LH line}, {ME line}, {MF line}, {MG line}, and {MH line} have been joined.\n\nAnd since {KE line} is equal to {KH line}, and angle {EKH angle} is a right-angle, the (square) on the {HE line} is thus double the (square) on {EK line} [Prop. 1.47].\nAgain, since {LK line} is equal to {KE line}, and angle {LKE angle} is a right-angle, the (square) on {EL line} is thus double the (square) on {EK line} [Prop. 1.47].\nAnd the (square) on {HE line} was also shown (to be) double the (square) on {EK line}.\nThus, the (square) on {LE line} is equal to the (square) on {EH line}.\nThus, {LE line} is equal to {EH line}.\nSo, for the same (reasons), {LH line} is also equal to {HE line}.\nTriangle {LEH polygon} is thus equilateral.\nSo, similarly, we can show that each of the remaining triangles, whose bases are the sides of the square {EFGH polygon}, and apexes the points {L point} and {M point}, are equilateral.\nThus, an octahedron contained by eight equilateral triangles has been constructed.\n\nSo, it is also necessary to enclose it by the given sphere, and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double the (square) on the side of the octahedron.\n\nFor since the three (straight-lines) {LK line}, {KM line}, and {KE line} are equal to one another, the semi-circle drawn on {LM line} will thus also pass through {E point}.\nAnd, for the same (reasons), if {LM line} remains (fixed), and the semi-circle is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, then it will also pass through points {F point}, {G point}, and {H point}, and the octahedron will have been enclosed by a sphere.\nSo, I say that (it is) also (enclosed) by the given (sphere).\nFor since {LK line} is equal to {KM line}, and {KE line} (is) common, and they contain right-angles, the base {LE line} is thus equal to the base {EM line} [Prop. 1.4].\nAnd since angle {LEM angle} is a right-angle—for (it is) in a semi-circle [Prop. 3.31]—the (square) on {LM line} is thus double the (square) on {LE line} [Prop. 1.47].\nAgain, since {AC line} is equal to {CB line}, {AB line} is double {BC line}.\nAnd as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so the (square) on {AB line} (is) to the (square) on {BD line} [Prop. 6.8, Def. 5.9].\nThus, the (square) on {AB line} is double the (square) on {BD line}.\nAnd the (square) on {LM line} was also shown (to be) double the (square) on {LE line}.\nAnd the (square) on {DB line} is equal to the (square) on {LE line}.\nFor {EH line} was made equal to {DB line}.\nThus, the (square) on {AB line} (is) also equal to the (square) on {LM line}.\nThus, {AB line} (is) equal to {LM line}.\nAnd {AB line} is the diameter of the given sphere.\nThus, {LM line} is equal to the diameter of the given sphere.\n\nThus, the octahedron has been enclosed by the given sphere, and it has been simultaneously proved that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double the (square) on the side of the octahedron.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "To construct a cube, and to enclose (it) in a sphere, like in the (case of the) pyramid, and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times the (square) on the side of the cube.\n\nLet the diameter {AB line} of the given sphere be laid out, and let it have been cut at {C point} such that {AC line} is double {CB line}.\nAnd let the semi-circle {ADB arc O} have been drawn on {AB line}.\nAnd let {CD line} have been drawn from {C point} at right-angles to {AB line}.\nAnd let {DB line} have been joined.\nAnd let the square {EFGH polygon}, having (its) side equal to {DB line}, be laid out.\nAnd let {EK line}, {FL line}, {GM line}, and {HN line} have been drawn from (points) {E point}, {F point}, {G point}, and {H point}, (respectively), at right-angles to the plane of square {EFGH polygon}.\nAnd let {EK line}, {FL line}, {GM line}, and {HN line}, equal to one of {EF line}, {FG line}, {GH line}, and {HE line}, have been cut off from {EK line}, {FL line}, {GM line}, and {HN line}, respectively.\nAnd let {KL line}, {LM line}, {MN line}, and {NK line} have been joined.\nThus, a cube contained by six equal squares has been constructed.\n\nSo, it is also necessary to enclose it by the given sphere, and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times the (square) on the side of the cube.\n\nFor let {KG line} and {EG line} have been joined.\nAnd since angle {KEG angle} is a right-angle—on account of {KE line} also being at right-angles to the plane {EG polygon}, and manifestly also to the straight-line {EG line} [Def. 11.3]—the semi-circle drawn on {KG line} will thus also pass through point {E point}.\nAgain, since {GF line} is at right-angles to each of {FL line} and {FE line}, {GF line} is thus also at right-angles to the plane {FK line} [Prop. 11.4].\nHence, if we also join {FK line} then {GF line} will also be at right-angles to {FK line}.\nAnd, again, on account of this, the semi-circle drawn on {GK line} will also pass through point {F point}.\nSimilarly, it will also pass through the remaining (angular) points of the cube.\nSo, if {KG line} remains (fixed), and the semi-circle is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, then the cube will have been enclosed by a sphere.\nSo, I say that (it is) also (enclosed) by the given (sphere).\nFor since {GF line} is equal to {FE line}, and the angle at {F point} is a right-angle, the (square) on {EG line} is thus double the (square) on {EF line} [Prop. 1.47].\nAnd {EF line} (is) equal to {EK line}.\nThus, the (square) on {EG line} is double the (square) on {EK line}.\nHence, the (sum of the squares) on {GE line} and {EK line}—that is to say, the (square) on {GK line} [Prop. 1.47]—is three times the (square) on {EK line}.\nAnd since {AB line} is three times {BC line}, and as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so the (square) on {AB line} (is) to the (square) on {BD line} [Prop. 6.8, Def. 5.9], the (square) on {AB line} (is) thus three times the (square) on {BD line}.\nAnd the (square) on {GK line} was also shown (to be) three times the (square) on {KE line}.\nAnd {KE line} was made equal to {DB line}.\nThus, {KG line} (is) also equal to {AB line}.\nAnd {AB line} is the radius of the given sphere.\nThus, {KG line} is also equal to the diameter of the given sphere.\n\nThus, the cube has been enclosed by the given sphere.\nAnd it has simultaneously been shown that the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times the (square) on the side of the cube.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "To construct an icosahedron, and to enclose (it) in a sphere, like the aforementioned figures, and to show that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.\n\nLet the diameter {AB line} of the given sphere be laid out, and let it have been cut at {C point} such that {AC line} is four times {CB line} [Prop. 6.10].\nAnd let the semi-circle {ADB arc o} have been drawn on {AB line}.\nAnd let the straight-line {CD line} have been drawn from {C point} at right-angles to {AB line}.\nAnd let {DB line} have been joined.\nAnd let the circle {EFGHK given} be set down, and let its radius be equal to {DB line}.\nAnd let the equilateral and equiangular pentagon {EFGHK polygon} have been inscribed in circle {EFGHK given} [Prop. 4.11].\nAnd let the circumferences {EF given}, {FG given}, {GH given}, {HK given}, and {KE given} have been cut in half at points {L point}, {M point}, {N point}, {O point}, and {P point} (respectively).\nAnd let {LM line}, {MN line}, {NO line}, {OP line}, {PL line}, and {EP line} have been joined.\nThus, pentagon {LMNOP polygon} is also equilateral, and {EP line} (is) the side of the decagon (inscribed in the circle).\nAnd let the straight-lines {EQ line}, {FR line}, {GS line}, {HT line}, and {KU line}, which are equal to the radius of circle {EFGHK given}, have been set up at right-angles to the plane of the circle, at points {E point}, {F point}, {G point}, {H point}, and {K point} (respectively).\nAnd let {QR line}, {RS line}, {ST line}, {TU line}, {UQ line}, {QL line}, {LR line}, {RM line}, {MS line}, {SN line}, {NT line}, {TO line}, {OU line}, {UP line}, and {PQ line} have been joined.\n\nAnd since {EQ line} and {KU line} are each at right-angles to the same plane, {EQ line} is thus parallel to {KU line} [Prop. 11.6].\nAnd it is also equal to it.\nAnd straight-lines joining equal and parallel (straight-lines) on the same side are (themselves) equal and parallel [Prop. 1.33].\nThus, {QU line} is equal and parallel to {EK line}.\nAnd {EK line} (is the side) of an equilateral pentagon (inscribed in circle {EFGHK given}).\nThus, {QU line} (is) also the side of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in circle {EFGHK given}.\nSo, for the same (reasons), {QR line}, {RS line}, {ST line}, and {TU line} are also the sides of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in circle {EFGHK given}.\nPentagon {QRSTU polygon} (is) thus equilateral.\nAnd side {QE line} is (the side) of a hexagon (inscribed in circle {EFGHK given}), and {EP line} (the side) of a decagon, and (angle) {QEP angle} is a right-angle, thus {QP line} is (the side) of a pentagon (inscribed in the same circle).\nFor the square on the side of a pentagon is (equal to the sum of) the (squares) on (the sides of) a hexagon and a decagon inscribed in the same circle [Prop. 13.10].\nSo, for the same (reasons), {PU line} is also the side of a pentagon.\nAnd {QU line} is also (the side) of a pentagon.\nThus, triangle {QPU polygon} is equilateral.\nSo, for the same (reasons), (triangles) {QLR polygon}, {RMS polygon}, {SNT polygon}, and {TOU polygon} are each also equilateral.\nAnd since {QL line} and {QP line} were each shown (to be the sides) of a pentagon, and {LP line} is also (the side) of a pentagon, triangle {QLP polygon} is thus equilateral.\nSo, for the same (reasons), triangles {LRM polygon}, {MSN polygon}, {NTO polygon}, and {OUP polygon} are each also equilateral.\n\nLet the center, point {V point}, of circle {EFGHK given} have been found [Prop. 3.1].\nAnd let {VZ line} have been set up, at (point) {V point}, at right-angles to the plane of the circle.\nAnd let it have been produced on the other side (of the circle), like {VX line}.\nAnd let {VW line} have been cut off (from {XZ line} so as to be equal to the side) of a hexagon, and each of {VX line} and {WZ line} (so as to be equal to the side) of a decagon.\nAnd let {QZ line}, {QW line}, {UZ line}, {EV line}, {LV line}, {LX line}, and {XM line} havebeen joined.\n\nAnd since {VW line} and {QE line} are each at right-angles to the plane of the circle, {VW line} is thus parallel to {QE line} [Prop. 11.6].\nAnd they are also equal.\n{EV line} and {QW line} are thus equal and parallel (to one another) [Prop. 1.33].\nAnd {EV line} (is the side) of a hexagon.\nThus, {QW line} (is) also (the side) of a hexagon.\nAnd since {QW line} is (the side) of a hexagon, and {WZ line} (the side) of a decagon, and angle {QWZ angle} is a right-angle [Def. 11.3, Prop. 1.29], {QZ line} is thus (the side) of a pentagon [Prop. 13.10].\nSo, for the same (reasons), {UZ line} is also (the side) of a pentagon—inasmuch as, if we join {VK line} and {WU line} then they will be equal and opposite.\nAnd {VK line}, being (equal) to the radius (of the circle), is (the side) of a hexagon [Prop. 4.15 corr.].\nThus, {WU line} (is) also the side of a hexagon.\nAnd {WZ line} (is the side) of a decagon, and (angle) {UWZ angle} (is) a right-angle.\nThus, {UZ line} (is the side) of a pentagon [Prop. 13.10].\nAnd {QU line} is also (the side) of a pentagon.\nTriangle {QUZ polygon} is thus equilateral.\nSo, for the same (reasons), each of the remaining triangles, whose bases are the straight-lines {QR line}, {RS line}, {ST line}, and {TU line}, and apexes the point {Z point}, are also equilateral.\nAgain, since {VL line} (is the side) of a hexagon, and {VX line} (the side) of a decagon, and angle {LVX angle} is a right-angle, {LX line} is thus (the side) of a pentagon [Prop. 13.10].\nSo, for the same (reasons), if we join {MV line} , which is (the side) of a hexagon, {MX line} is also inferred (to be the side) of a pentagon.\nAnd {LM line} is also (the side) of a pentagon.\nThus, triangle {LMX polygon} is equilateral.\nSo, similarly, it can be shown that each of the remaining triangles, whose bases are the (straight-lines) {MN line} , {NO line}, {OP line}, and {PL line}, and apexes the point {X point}, are also equilateral.\nThus, an icosahedron contained by twenty equilateral triangles has been constructed.\n\nSo, it is also necessary to enclose it in the given sphere, and to show that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.\n\nFor, since {VW line} is (the side) of a hexagon, and {WZ line} (the side) of a decagon, {VZ line} has thus been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {W point} , and {VW line} is its greater piece [Prop. 13.9].\nThus, as {ZV line} is to {VW line}, so {VW line} (is) to {WZ line}.\nAnd {VW line} (is) equal to {VE line}, and {WZ line} to {VX line}.\nThus, as {ZV line} is to {VE line}, so {EV line} (is) to {VX line}.\nAnd angles {ZVE angle} and {EVX angle} are right-angles.\nThus, if we join straight-line {EZ line} then angle {XEZ angle} will be a right-angle, on account of the similarity of triangles {XEZ polygon} and {VEZ polygon} [Prop. 6.8].\nSo, for the same (reasons), since as {ZV line} is to {VW line}, so {VW line} (is) to {WZ line}, and {ZV line} (is) equal to {XW line}, and {VW line} to {WQ line}, thus as {XW line} is to {WQ line}, so {QW line} (is) to {WZ line}.\nAnd, again, on account of this, if we join {QX line} then the angle at {Q point} will be a right-angle [Prop. 6.8].\nThus, the semi-circle drawn on {XZ line} will also pass through {Q point} [Prop. 3.31].\nAnd if {XZ line} remains fixed, and the semi-circle is carried around, and again established at the same (position) from which it began to be moved, then it will also pass through (point) {Q point}, and (through) the remaining (angular) points of the icosahedron.\nAnd the icosahedron will have been enclosed by a sphere.\nSo, I say that (it is) also (enclosed) by the given (sphere).\nFor let {VW line} have been cut in half at {a point}.\nAnd since the straight-line {VZ line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {W point}, and {ZW line} is its lesser piece, then the square on {ZW line} added to half of the greater piece, {Wa line}, is five times the (square) on half of the greater piece [Prop. 13.3].\nThus, the (square) on {Za line} is five times the (square) on {aW line}.\nAnd {ZX line} is double {Za line}, and {VW line} double {aW line}.\nThus, the (square) on {ZX line} is five times the (square) on {WV line}.\nAnd since {AC line} is four times {CB line}, {AB line} is thus five times {BC line}.\nAnd as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so the (square) on {AB line} (is) to the (square) on {BD line} [Prop. 6.8, Def. 5.9].\nThus, the (square) on {AB line} is five times the (square) on {BD line}.\nAnd the (square) on {ZX line} was also shown (to be) five times the (square) on {VW line}.\nAnd {DB line} is equal to {VW line}.\nFor each of them is equal to the radius of circle {EFGHK given}.\nThus, {AB line} (is) also equal to {XZ line}.\nAnd {AB line} is the diameter of the given sphere.\nThus, {XZ line} is equal to the diameter of the given sphere.\nThus, the icosahedron has been enclosed by the given sphere.\n\nSo, I say that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.\nFor since the diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is five times the (square) on the radius of circle {EFGHK given}, the radius of circle {EFGHK given} is thus also rational.\nHence, its diameter is also rational.\nAnd if an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a circle having a rational diameter then the side of the pentagon is that irrational (straight-line) called minor [Prop. 13.11].\nAnd the side of pentagon {EFGHK polygon} is (the side) of the icosahedron.\nThus, the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor.\n\nCorollary\n\nSo, (it is) clear, from this, that the square on the diameter of the sphere is five times the square on the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described, and that the the diameter of the sphere is the sum of (the side) of the hexagon, and two of (the sides) of the decagon, inscribed in the same circle.\n",

    "prose": "To construct a dodecahedron, and to enclose (it) in a sphere, like the aforementioned figures, and to show that the side of the dodecahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called an apotome.\n\nLet two planes of the aforementioned cube [Prop. 13.15], {ABCD polygon} and {CBEF polygon}, (which are) at right-angles to one another, be laid out.\nAnd let the sides {AB line}, {BC line}, {CD line}, {DA line}, {EF line}, {EB line}, and {FC line} have each been cut in half at points {G point}, {H point}, {K point}, {L point}, {M point}, {N point}, and {O point} (respectively).\nAnd let {GK line}, {HL line}, {MH line}, and {NO line} have been joined.\nAnd let {NP line}, {PO line}, and {HQ line} have each been cut in extreme and mean ratio at points {R point}, {S point}, and {T point} (respectively).\nAnd let their greater pieces be {RP line}, {PS line}, and {TQ line} (respectively).\nAnd let {RU line}, {SV line}, and {TW line} have been set up on the exterior side of the cube, at points {R point}, {S point}, and {T point} (respectively), at right-angles to the planes of the cube.\nAnd let them be made equal to {RP line}, {PS line}, and {TQ line}.\nAnd let {UB line}, {BW line}, {WC line}, {CV line}, and {VU line} have been joined.\n\nI say that the pentagon {UBWCV polygon} is equilateral, and in one plane, and, further, equiangular.\nFor let {RB line}, {SB line}, and {VB line} have been joined.\nAnd since the straight-line {NP line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {R point}, and {RP line} is the greater piece, the (sum of the squares) on {PN line} and {NR line} is thus three times the (square) on {RP line} [Prop. 13.4].\nAnd {PN line} (is) equal to {NB line}, and {PR line} to {RU line}.\nThus, the (sum of the squares) on {BN line} and {NR line} is three times the (square) on {RU line}.\nAnd the (square) on {BR line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {BN line} and {NR line} [Prop. 1.47].\nThus, the (square) on {BR line} is three times the (square) on {RU line}.\nHence, the (sum of the squares) on {BR line} and {RU line} is four times the (square) on {RU line}.\nAnd the (square) on {BU line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {BR line} and {RU line} [Prop. 1.47].\nThus, the (square) on {BU line} is four times the (square) on {UR line}.\nThus, {BU line} is double {RU line}.\nAnd {VU line} is also double {UR line}, inasmuch as {SR line} is also double {PR line}—that is to say, {RU line}.\nThus, {BU line} (is) equal to {UV line}.\nSo, similarly, it can be shown that each of {BW line}, {WC line}, {CV line} is equal to each of {BU line} and {UV line}.\nThus, pentagon {BUVCW polygon} is equilateral.\nSo, I say that it is also in one plane.\nFor let {PX line} have been drawn from {P point}, parallel to each of {RU line} and {SV line}, on the exterior side of the cube.\nAnd let {XH line} and {HW line} have been joined.\nI say that {XHW line} is a straight-line.\nFor since {HQ line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {T point}, and {QT line} is its greater piece, thus as {HQ line} is to {QT line}, so {QT line} (is) to {TH line}.\nAnd {HQ line} (is) equal to {HP line}, and {QT line} to each of {TW line} and {PX line}.\nThus, as {HP line} is to {PX line}, so {WT line} (is) to {TH line}.\nAnd {HP line} is parallel to {TW line}.\nFor of each of them is at right-angles to the plane {BD polygon} [Prop. 11.6].\nAnd {TH line} (is parallel) to {PX line}.\nFor each of them is at right-angles to the plane {BF polygon} [Prop. 11.6].\nAnd if two triangles, like {XPH polygon} and {HTW polygon}, having two sides proportional to two sides, are placed together at a single angle such that their corresponding sides are also parallel then the remaining sides will be straight-on (to one another) [Prop. 6.32].\nThus, {XH line} is straight-on to {HW line}.\nAnd every straight-line is in one plane [Prop. 11.1].\nThus, pentagon {UBWCV polygon} is in one plane.\n\nSo, I say that it is also equiangular.\n\nFor since the straight-line {NP line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {R point}, and {PR line} is the greater piece [thus as the sum of {NP line} and {PR line} is to {PN line}, so {NP line} (is) to {PR line}], and {PR line} (is) equal to {PS line} [thus as {SN line} is to {NP line}, so {NP line} (is) to {PS line}], {NS line} has thus also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {P point}, and {NP line} is the greater piece [Prop. 13.5].\nThus, the (sum of the squares) on {NS line} and {SP line} is three times the (square) on {NP line} [Prop. 13.4].\nAnd {NP line} (is) equal to {NB line}, and {PS line} to {SV line}.\nThus, the (sum of the) squares on {NS line} and {SV line} is three times the (square) on {NB line}.\nHence, the (sum of the squares) on {VS line}, {SN line}, and {NB line} is four times the (square) on {NB line}.\nAnd the (square) on {SB line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {SN line} and {NB line} [Prop. 1.47].\nThus, the (sum of the squares) on {BS line} and {SV line} —that is to say, the (square) on {BV line} [for angle {VSB angle} (is) a right-angle]—is four times the (square) on {NB line} [Def. 11.3, Prop. 1.47].\nThus, {VB line} is double {BN line}.\nAnd {BC line} (is) also double {BN line}.\nThus, {BV line} is equal to {BC line}.\nAnd since the two (straight-lines) {BU line} and {UV line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {BW line} and {WC line} (respectively), and the base {BV line} (is) equal to the base {BC line}, angle {BUV angle} is thus equal to angle {BWC angle} [Prop. 1.8].\nSo, similarly, we can show that angle {UVC angle} is equal to angle {BWC angle}.\nThus, the three angles {BWC angle}, {BUV angle}, and {UVC angle} are equal to one another.\nAnd if three angles of an equilateral pentagon are equal to one another then the pentagon is equiangular [Prop. 13.7].\nThus, pentagon {BUVCW polygon} is equiangular.\nAnd it was also shown (to be) equilateral.\nThus, pentagon {BUVCW polygon} is equilateral and equiangular, and it is on one of the sides, {BC line}, of the cube.\nThus, if we make the same construction on each of the twelve sides of the cube then some solid figure contained by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons will have been constructed, which is called a dodecahedron.\n\nSo, it is necessary to enclose it in the given sphere, and to show that the side of the dodecahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called an apotome.\n\nFor let {XP line} have been produced, and let (the produced straight-line) be {XZ line}.\nThus, {PZ line} meets the diameter of the cube, and they cut one another in half.\nFor, this has been proved in the penultimate theorem of the eleventh book [Prop. 11.38].\nLet them cut (one another) at {Z point}.\nThus, {Z point} is the center of the sphere enclosing the cube, and {ZP line} (is) half the side of the cube.\nSo, let {UZ line} have been joined.\nAnd since the straight-line {NS line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {P point}, and its greater piece is {NP line}, the (sum of the squares) on {NS line} and {SP line} is thus three times the (square) on {NP line} [Prop. 13.4].\nAnd {NS line} (is) equal to {XZ line}, inasmuch as {NP line} is also equal to {PZ line}, and {XP line} to {PS line}.\nBut, indeed, {PS line} (is) also (equal) to {XU line}, since (it is) also (equal) to {RP line}.\nThus, the (sum of the squares) on {ZX line} and {XU line} is three times the (square) on {NP line}.\nAnd the (square) on {UZ line} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {ZX line} and {XU line} [Prop. 1.47].\nThus, the (square) on {UZ line} is three times the (square) on {NP line}.\nAnd the square on the radius of the sphere enclosing the cube is also three times the (square) on half the side of the cube.\nFor it has previously been demonstrated (how to) construct the cube, and to enclose (it) in a sphere, and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times the (square) on the side of the cube [Prop. 13.15].\nAnd if the (square on the) whole (is three times) the (square on the) whole, then the (square on the) half (is) also (three times) the (square on the) half.\nAnd {NP line} is half of the side of the cube.\nThus, {UZ line} is equal to the radius of the sphere enclosing the cube.\nAnd {Z point} is the center of the sphere enclosing the cube.\nThus, point {U point} is on the surface of the sphere.\nSo, similarly, we can show that each of the remaining angles of the dodecahedron is also on the surface of the sphere.\nThus, the dodecahedron has been enclosed by the given sphere.\n\nSo, I say that the side of the dodecahedron is that irrational straight-line called an apotome.\n\nFor since {RP line} is the greater piece of {NP line}, which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and {PS line} is the greater piece of {PO line}, which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, {RS line} is thus the greater piece of the whole of {NO line}, which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio.\n[Thus, since as {NP line} is to {PR line}, (so) {PR line} (is) to {RN line}, and (the same is also true) of the doubles.\nFor parts have the same ratio as similar multiples (taken in corresponding order) [Prop. 5.15].\nThus, as {NO line} (is) to {RS line}, so {RS line} (is) to the sum of {NR line} and {SO line}.\nAnd {NO line} (is) greater than {RS line}.\nThus, {RS line} (is) also greater than the sum of {NR line} and {SO line} [Prop. 5.14].\nThus, {NO line} has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and {RS line} is its greater piece.]\nAnd {RS line} (is) equal to {UV line}.\nThus, {UV line} is the greater piece of {NO line}, which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio.\nAnd since the diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is three times the (square) on the side of the cube, {NO line}, which is the side of the cube, is thus rational.\nAnd if a rational (straight)-line is cut in extreme and mean ratio then each of the pieces is the irrational (straight-line called) an apotome.\n\nThus, {UV line}, which is the side of the dodecahedron, is the irrational (straight-line called) an apotome [Prop. 13.6].\n\nCorollary\n\nSo, (it is) clear, from this, that the side of the dodecahedron is the greater piece of the side of the cube, when is cut in extreme and mean ratio.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "To set out the sides of the five (aforementioned) figures, and to compare (them) with one another.\n\nLet the diameter, {AB line}, of the given sphere be laid out.\nAnd let it have been cut at {C point}, such that {AC line} is equal to {CB line}, and at {D point}, such that {AD line} is double {DB line}.\nAnd let the semi-circle {AEB arc C} have been drawn on {AB line}.\nAnd let {CE line} and {DF line} have been drawn from {C point} and {D point} (respectively), at right-angles to {AB line}.\nAnd let {AF line}, {FB line}, and {EB line} have been joined.\nAnd since {AD line} is double {DB line}, {AB line} is thus triple {BD line}.\nThus, via conversion, {BA line} is one and a half times {AD line}.\nAnd as {BA line} (is) to {AD line}, so the (square) on {BA line} (is) to the (square) on {AF line} [Def. 5.9].\nFor triangle {AFB polygon} is equiangular to triangle {AFD polygon} [Prop. 6.8].\nThus, the (square) on {BA line} is one and a half times the (square) on {AF line}.\nAnd the square on the diameter of the sphere is also one and a half times the (square) on the side of the pyramid [Prop. 13.13].\nAnd {AB line} is the diameter of the sphere.\nThus, {AF line} is equal to the side of the pyramid.\n\nAgain, since {AD line} is double {DB line}, {AB line} is thus triple {BD line}.\nAnd as {AB line} (is) to {BD line}, so the (square) on {AB line} (is) to the (square) on {BF line} [Prop. 6.8, Def. 5.9].\nThus, the (square) on {AB line} is three times the (square) on {BF line}.\nAnd the square on the diameter of the sphere is also three times the (square) on the side of the cube [Prop. 13.15].\nAnd {AB line} is the diameter of the sphere.\nThus, {BF line} is the side of the cube.\n\nAnd since {AC line} is equal to {CB line}, {AB line} is thus double {BC line}.\nAnd as {AB line} (is) to {BC line}, so the (square) on {AB line} (is) to the (square) on {BE line} [Prop. 6.8, Def. 5.9].\nThus, the (square) on {AB line} is double the (square) on {BE line}.\nAnd the square on the diameter of the sphere is also double the (square) on the side of the octahedron [Prop. 13.14].\nAnd {AB line} is the diameter of the given sphere.\nThus, {BE line} is the side of the octahedron.\n\nSo let {AG line} have been drawn from point {A point} at right-angles to the straight-line {AB line}.\nAnd let {AG line} be made equal to {AB line}.\nAnd let {GC line} have been joined.\nAnd let {HK line} have been drawn from {H point}, perpendicular to {AB line}.\nAnd since {GA line} is double {AC line}.\nFor {GA line} (is) equal to {AB line}.\nAnd as {GA line} (is) to {AC line}, so {HK line} (is) to {KC line} [Prop. 6.4].\n{HK line} (is) thus also double {KC line}.\nThus, the (square) on {HK line} is four times the (square) on {KC line}.\nThus, the (sum of the squares) on {HK line} and {KC line}, which is the (square) on {HC line} [Prop. 1.47], is five times the (square) on {KC line}.\nAnd {HC line} (is) equal to {CB line}.\nThus, the (square) on {BC line} (is) five times the (square) on {CK line}.\nAnd since {AB line} is double {CB line}, of which {AD line} is double {DB line}, the remainder {BD line} is thus double the remainder {DC line}.\n{BC line} (is) thus triple {CD line}.\nThe (square) on {BC line} (is) thus nine times the (square) on {CD line}.\nAnd the (square) on {BC line} (is) five times the (square) on {CK line}.\nThus, the (square) on {CK line} (is) greater than the (square) on {CD line}.\n{CK line} is thus greater than {CD line}.\nLet {CL line} be made equal to {CK line}.\nAnd let {LM line} have been drawn from {L point} at right-angles to {AB line}.\nAnd let {MB line} have been joined.\nAnd since the (square) on {BC line} is five times the (square) on {CK line}, and {AB line} is double {BC line}, and {KL line} double {CK line}, the (square) on {AB line} is thus five times the (square) on {KL line}.\nAnd the square on the diameter of the sphere is also five times the (square) on the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described [Prop. 13.16 corr.].\nAnd {AB line} is the diameter of the sphere.\nThus, {KL line} is the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described.\nThus, {KL line} is (the side) of the hexagon (inscribed) in the aforementioned circle [Prop. 4.15 corr.].\nAnd since the diameter of the sphere is composed of (the side) of the hexagon, and two of (the sides) of the decagon, inscribed in the aforementioned circle, and {AB line} is the diameter of the sphere, and {KL line} the side of the hexagon, and {AK line} (is) equal to {LB line}, thus {AK line} and {LB line} are each sides of the decagon inscribed in the circle from which the icosahedron has been described.\nAnd since {LB line} is (the side) of the decagon.\nAnd {ML line} (is the side) of the hexagon—for (it is) equal to {KL line}, since (it is) also (equal) to {HK line}, for they are equally far from the center.\nAnd {HK line} and {KL line} are each double {KC line}.\n{MB line} is thus (the side) of the pentagon (inscribed in the circle) [Props. 13.10, 1.47].\nAnd (the side) of the pentagon is (the side) of the icosahedron [Prop. 13.16].\nThus, {MB line} is (the side) of the icosahedron.\n\nAnd since {FB line} is the side of the cube, let it have been cut in extreme and mean ratio at {N point}, and let {NB line} be the greater piece.\nThus, {NB line} is the side of the dodecahedron [Prop. 13.17 corr.].\n\nAnd since the (square) on the diameter of the sphere was shown (to be) one and a half times the square on the side, {AF line}, of the pyramid, and twice the square on (the side), {BE line}, of the octahedron, and three times the square on (the side), {FB line}, of the cube, thus, of whatever (parts) the (square) on the diameter of the sphere (makes) six, of such (parts) the (square) on (the side) of the pyramid (makes) four, and (the square) on (the side) of the octahedron three, and (the square) on (the side) of the cube two.\nThus, the (square) on the side of the pyramid is one and a third times the square on the side of the octahedron, and double the square on (the side) of the cube.\nAnd the (square) on (the side) of the octahedron is one and a half times the square on (the side) of the cube.\nTherefore, the aforementioned sides of the three figures—I mean, of the pyramid, and of the octahedron, and of the cube— are in rational ratios to one another.\nAnd (the sides of) the remaining two (figures)—I mean, of the icosahedron, and of the dodecahedron—are neither in rational ratios to one another, nor to the (sides) of the aforementioned (three figures).\nFor they are irrational (straight lines): (namely), a minor [Prop. 13.16], and an apotome [Prop. 13.17].\n\n(And), we can show that the side, {MB line}, of the icosahedron is greater that the (side), {NB line}, or the dodecahedron, as follows.\n\nFor, since triangle {FDB polygon} is equiangular to triangle {FAB polygon} [Prop. 6.8], proportionally, as {DB line} is to {BF line}, so {BF line} (is) to {BA line} [Prop. 6.4].\nAnd since three straight-lines are (continually) proportional, as the first (is) to the third, so the (square) on the first (is) to the (square) on the second [Def. 5.9, Prop. 6.20 corr.].\nThus, as {DB line} is to {BA line}, so the (square) on {DB line} (is) to the (square) on {BF line}.\nThus, inversely, as {AB line} (is) to {BD line}, so the (square) on {FB line} (is) to the (square) on {BD line}.\nAnd {AB line} (is) triple {BD line}.\nThus, the (square) on {FB line} (is) three times the (square) on {BD line}.\nAnd the (square) on {AD line} is also four times the (square) on {DB line}.\nFor {AD line} (is) double {DB line}.\nThus, the (square) on {AD line} (is) greater than the (square) on {FB line}.\nThus, {AD line} (is) greater than {FB line}.\nThus, {AL line} is much greater than {FB line}.\nAnd {KL line} is the greater piece of {AL line}, which is cut in extreme and mean ratio—inasmuch as {LK line} is (the side) of the hexagon, and {KA line} (the side) of the decagon [Prop. 13.9].\nAnd {NB line} is the greater piece of {FB line}, which is cut in extreme and mean ratio.\nThus, {KL line} (is) greater than {NB line}.\nAnd {KL line} (is) equal to {LM line}.\nThus, {LM line} (is) greater than {NB line} [and {MB line} is greater than {LM line}].\nThus, {MB line}, which is (the side) of the icosahedron, is much greater than {NB line}, which is (the side) of the dodecahedron.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n\nSo, I say that, beside the five aforementioned figures, no other (solid) figure can be constructed (which is) contained by equilateral and equiangular (planes), equal to one another.\n\nFor a solid angle cannot be constructed from two triangles, or indeed (two) planes (of any sort) [Def. 11.11].\nAnd (the solid angle) of the pyramid (is constructed) from three (equiangular) triangles, and (that) of the octahedron from four (triangles), and (that) of the icosahedron from (five) triangles.\nAnd a solid angle cannot be (made) from six equilateral and equiangular triangles set up together at one point.\nFor, since the angles of a equilateral triangle are (each) two-thirds of a right-angle, the (sum of the) six (plane) angles (containing the solid angle) will be four right-angles.\nThe very thing (is) impossible.\nFor every solid angle is contained by (plane angles whose sum is) less than four right-angles [Prop. 11.21].\nSo, for the same (reasons), a solid angle cannot be constructed from more than six plane angles (equal to two-thirds of a right-angle) either.\nAnd the (solid) angle of a cube is contained by three squares.\nAnd (a solid angle contained) by four (squares is) impossible.\nFor, again, the (sum of the plane angles containing the solid angle) will be four right-angles.\nAnd (the solid angle) of a dodecahedron (is contained) by three equilateral and equiangular pentagons.\nAnd (a solid angle contained) by four (equiangular pentagons is) impossible.\nFor, the angle of an equilateral pentagon being one and one-fifth of right-angle, four (such) angles will be greater (in sum) than four right-angles.\nThe very thing (is) impossible.\nAnd, on account of the same absurdity, a solid angle cannot be constructed from any other (equiangular) polygonal figures either.\n\nThus, beside the five aforementioned figures, no other solid figure can be constructed (which is) contained by equilateral and equiangular (planes).\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "It can be shown that the angle of an equilateral and equiangular pentagon is one and one-fifth of a right-angle, as follows.\n\nFor let {ABCDE polygon} be an equilateral and equiangular pentagon, and let the circle {ABCDE circle F} have been circumscribed about it [Prop. 4.14].\nAnd let its center, {F point}, have been found [Prop. 3.1].\nAnd let {FA line}, {FB line}, {FC line}, {FD line}, and {FE line} have been joined.\nThus, they cut the angles of the pentagon in half at (points) {A point}, {B point}, {C point}, {D point}, and {E point} [Prop. 1.4].\nAnd since the five angles at {F point} are equal (in sum) to four right-angles, and are also equal (to one another), (any) one of them, like {AFB angle}, is thus one less a fifth of a right-angle.\nThus, the (sum of the) remaining (angles in triangle {ABF polygon}), {FAB line} and {ABF line}, is one plus a fifth of a right-angle [Prop. 1.32].\nAnd {FAB angle} (is) equal to {FBC angle}.\nThus, the whole angle, {ABC angle}, of the pentagon is also one and one-fifth of a right-angle.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n\n",
