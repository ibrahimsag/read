continuously proportional and the outermost of them are prime to one another, or are continuously proportional and the outermost of them are not prime to one another, or are neither continuously proportional nor are the outermost of them prime to one another, or are continuously proportional and the outermost of them are prime to one another.\n\nIn fact, if {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} are continuously proportional, and the outermost of them, {A magnitude} and {C magnitude}, are prime to one another, (then) it has (already) been shown that it is impossible to find a fourth number proportional to them [Prop. 9.17].\nSo let {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} not be continuously proportional, (with) the outermost of them again being prime to one another.\nI say that, in this case, it is also impossible to find a fourth (number) proportional to them.\nFor, if possible, let it have been found, (and let it be) {D magnitude}.\nHence, it will be that as {A

equal to {E magnitude}.\nAnd thus {OG magnitude} is equal to {M magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {E magnitude}.\nAnd {FO magnitude} is also equal to {E magnitude}, and {E magnitude} to {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, and a unit.\nThus, the whole of {FG magnitude} is equal to {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, and {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, and a unit.\nAnd it is measured by them.\nI also say that {FG magnitude} will be measured by no other (numbers) except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, and a unit.\nFor, if possible, let some (number) {P magnitude} measure {FG magnitude}, and let {P magnitude} not be the same as any of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}.\nAnd as many times as {P magnitude} measures {FG magnitude}, so many units let there be in {Q magnitude}.\nThus, {Q magnitude} has made {FG magnitude} (by) multiplying {P magnitude}.\nBut, in fact, {E magnitude} has also made {FG magnitude} (by) multiplying {D magnitude}.\nThus, as {E magnitude} is to {Q magnitude}, so {P magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].\nAnd since {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude} are continually proportional, (starting) from a unit, {D magnitude} will thus not be measured by any other numbers except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude} [Prop. 9.13].\nAnd {P magnitude} was assumed not (to be) the same as any of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.\nThus, {P magnitude} does not measure {D magnitude}.\nBut, as {P magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, so {E magnitude} (is) to {Q magnitude}.\nThus, {E magnitude} does not measure {Q magnitude} either [Def. 7.20].\nAnd {E magnitude} is a prime (number).\nAnd every prime number [is] prime to every (number) which it does not measure [Prop. 7.29].\nThus, {E magnitude} and {Q magnitude} are prime to one another.\nAnd (numbers) prime (to one another are) also the least (of those numbers having the same ratio as them) [Prop. 7.21], and the least (numbers) measure those (numbers) having the same ratio as them an equal number of times, the leading (measuring) the leading, and the following the following [Prop. 7.20].\nAnd as {E magnitude} is to {Q magnitude}, (so) {P magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}.\nThus, {E magnitude} measures {P magnitude} the same number of times as {Q magnitude} (measures) {D magnitude}.\nAnd {D magnitude} is not measured by any other (numbers) except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.\nThus, {Q magnitude} is the same as one of {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}.\nLet it be the same as {B magnitude}.\nAnd as many as is the multitude of {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, let so many (of the set out numbers) have been taken, (starting) from {E magnitude}, (namely) {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}.\nAnd {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude} are in the same ratio as {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}.\nThus, via equality, as {B magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude}, (so) {E magnitude} (is) to {L magnitude} [Prop. 7.14].\nThus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {B magnitude}, {L magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from multiplying {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].\nBut, the (number created) from (multiplying) {D magnitude}, {E magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {Q magnitude}, {P magnitude}.\nThus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {Q magnitude}, {P magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {B magnitude}, {L magnitude}.\nThus, as {Q magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, (so) {L magnitude} (is) to {P magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].\nAnd {Q magnitude} is the same as {B magnitude}.\nThus, {L magnitude} is also the same as {P magnitude}.\nThe very thing (is) impossible.\nFor {P magnitude} was assumed not (to be) the same as any of the (numbers) set out.\nThus, {FG magnitude} cannot be measured by any number except {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, and a unit.\nAnd {FG magnitude} was shown (to be) equal to (the sumof) {A magnitude}, {B magnitude}, {C magnitude}, {D magnitude}, {E magnitude}, {HK magnitude}, {L magnitude}, {M magnitude}, and a unit.\nAnda perfect number is one which is equal to (the sum of) its own parts [Def. 7.22].\nThus, {FG magnitude} is a perfect (number).\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",
