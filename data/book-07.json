A number is part of a(nother) number, the lesser of the greater, when it measures the greater.\n\n4. But (the lesser is) parts (of the greater) when it does not measure it.\n\n5. And the greater (number is) a multiple of the lesser when it is measured by the lesser.\n\n6. An even number is one (which can be) divided in half.\n\n7. And an odd number is one (which can)not (be) divided in half, or which differs from an even number by a unit.\n\n8. An even-times-even number is one (which is) measured by an even number according to an even number.\n\n9. And an even-times-odd number is one (which is) measured by an even number according to an odd number.\n\n10. And an odd-times-odd number is one (which is) measured by an odd number according to an odd number.\n\n11. A prime number is one (which is) measured by a unit alone.\n\n12. Numbers prime to one another are those (which are) measured by a unit alone as a common measure.\n\n13. A composite number is one (which is) measured by some number.\n\n14. And numbers composite to one another are those (which are) measured by some number as a common measure.\n\n15. A number is said to multiply a(nother) number when the (number being) multiplied is added (to itself) as many times as there are units in the former (number), and (thereby) some (other number) is produced.\n\n16. And when two numbers multiplying one another make some (other number) then the (number so) created is called plane, and its sides (are) the numbers which multiply one another.\n\n17. And when three numbers multiplying one another make some (other number) then the (number so) created is (called) solid, and its sides (are) the numbers which multiply one another.\n\n18. A square number is an equal times an equal, or (a plane number) contained by two equal numbers.\n\n19. And a cube (number) is an equal times an equal times an equal, or (a solid number) contained by three equal numbers.\n\n20. Numbers are proportional when the first is the same multiple, or the same part, or the same parts, of the second that the third (is) of the fourth.\n\n21. Similar plane and solid numbers are those having proportional sides.\n\n22. A perfect number is that which is equal to its own parts.\n"

say that ({C magnitude}) is also the least (number which they both measure).\nFor if not, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} will (both) measure some (other) number which is less than {C magnitude}.\nLet them (both) measure {D magnitude} (which is less than {C magnitude}).\nAnd as many times as {A magnitude} measures {D magnitude}, so many units let there be in {E magnitude}.\nAnd as many times as {B magnitude} measures {D magnitude}, so many units let there be in {F magnitude}.\nThus, {A magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}, and {B magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}.\nThus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude} and {E magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {B magnitude} and {F magnitude}.\nThus, as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].\nAnd {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} are prime (to one another), and prime (numbers) are the least (of those numbers having the same ratio) [Prop. 7.21], and the least (numbers) measure those (numbers) having the same ratio (as them) an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser [Prop. 7.20].\nThus, {B magnitude} measures {E magnitude}, as the following (number measuring) the following.\nAnd since {A magnitude} has made {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {B magnitude} and {E magnitude} (respectively), thus as {B magnitude} is to {E magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].\nAnd {B magnitude} measures {E magnitude}.\nThus, {C magnitude} also measures {D magnitude}, the greater (measuring) the lesser.\nThe very thing is impossible.\nThus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} do not (both) measure some number which is less than {C magnitude}.\nThus, {C magnitude} is the least (number) which is measured by (both) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.\n\n{figure 2} So let {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} be not prime to one another.\nAnd let the least numbers, {F magnitude} and {E magnitude}, have been taken having the same ratio as {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (respectively) [Prop. 7.33].\nThus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude} and {E magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {B magnitude} and {F magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].\nAnd let {A magnitude} make {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude}.\nThus, {B magnitude} has also made {C magnitude} (by) multiplying {F magnitude}.\nThus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} (both) measure {C magnitude}.\nSo I say that ({C magnitude}) is also the least (number which they both measure).\nFor if not, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} will (both) measure some number which is less than {C magnitude}.\nLet them (both) measure {D magnitude} (which is less than {C magnitude}).\nAnd as many times as {A magnitude} measures {D magnitude}, so many units let there be in {G magnitude}.\nAnd as many times as {B magnitude} measures {D magnitude}, so many units let there be in {H magnitude}.\nThus, {A magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {G magnitude}, and {B magnitude} has made {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {H magnitude}.\nThus, the (number created) from (multiplying) {A magnitude} and {G magnitude} is equal to the (number created) from (multiplying) {B magnitude} and {H magnitude}.\nThus, as {A magnitude} is to {B magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude} [Prop. 7.19].\nAnd as {A magnitude} (is) to {B magnitude}, so {F magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}.\nThus, also, as {F magnitude} (is) to {E magnitude}, so {H magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude}.\nAnd {F magnitude} and {E magnitude} are the least (numbers having the same ratio as {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}), and the least (numbers) measure those (numbers) having the same ratio an equal number of times, the greater (measuring) the greater, and the lesser the lesser [Prop. 7.20].\nThus, {E magnitude} measures {G magnitude}.\nAnd since {A magnitude} has made {C magnitude} and {D magnitude} (by) multiplying {E magnitude} and {G magnitude} (respectively), thus as {E magnitude} is to {G magnitude}, so {C magnitude} (is) to {D magnitude} [Prop. 7.17].\nAnd {E magnitude} measures {G magnitude}.\nThus, {C magnitude} also measures {D magnitude}, the greater (measuring) the lesser.\nThe very thing is impossible.\nThus, {A magnitude} and {B magnitude} do not (both) measure some (number) which is less than {C magnitude}.\nThus, {C magnitude} (is) the least (number) which is measured by (both) {A magnitude} and {B magnitude}.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",
