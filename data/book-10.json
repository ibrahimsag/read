    "prose": "If there are two unequal straight-lines, and a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts which are) commensurable in length, then the square on the greater will be larger than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable [in length] with the greater.\nAnd if the square on the greater is larger than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable [in length] with the greater, and a (rectangle) equal to the fourth (part) of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater, then it divides it into (parts which are) commensurable in length.\n\nLet {A magnitude} and {BC magnitude} be two unequal straight-lines, of which (let) {BC magnitude} (be) the greater.\nAnd let a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser, {A magnitude}---that is, (equal) to the (square) on half of {A magnitude}---falling short by a square figure, have been applied to {BC magnitude}.\nAnd let it be the (rectangle contained) by {BD magnitude} and {DC magnitude} [see previous lemma].\nAnd let {BD magnitude} be commensurable in length with {DC magnitude}.\nI say that that the square on {BC magnitude} is greater than the (square on) {A magnitude} by (the square on some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({BC magnitude}).\n\nFor let {BC magnitude} have been cut in half at the point {E point} [Prop. 1.10].\nAnd let {EF magnitude} be made equal to {DE magnitude} [Prop. 1.3].\nThus, the remainder {DC magnitude} is equal to {BF magnitude}.\nAnd since the straight-line {BC magnitude} has been cut into equal (pieces) at {E point}, and into unequal (pieces) at {D point}, the rectangle contained by {BD magnitude} and {DC magnitude}, plus the square on {ED magnitude}, is thus equal to the square on {EC magnitude} [Prop. 2.5].\n(The same) also (for) the quadruples.\nThus, four times the (rectangle contained) by {BD magnitude} and {DC magnitude}, plus the quadruple of the (square) on {DE magnitude}, is equal to four times the square on {EC magnitude}.\nBut, the square on {A magnitude} is equal to the quadruple of the (rectangle contained) by {BD magnitude} and {DC magnitude}, and the square on {DF magnitude} is equal to the quadruple of the (square) on {DE magnitude}.\nFor {DF magnitude} is double {DE magnitude}.\nAnd the square on {BC magnitude} is equal to the quadruple of the (square) on {EC magnitude}.\nFor, again, {BC magnitude} is double {CE magnitude}.\nThus, the (sum of the) squares on {A magnitude} and {DF magnitude} is equal to the square on {BC magnitude}.\nHence, the (square) on {BC magnitude} is greater than the (square) on {A magnitude} by the (square) on {DF magnitude}.\nThus, {BC magnitude} is greater in square than {A magnitude} by {DF magnitude}.\nIt must also be shown that {BC magnitude} is commensurable (in length) with {DF magnitude}.\nFor since {BD magnitude} is commensurable in length with {DC magnitude}, {BC magnitude} is thus also commensurable in length with {CD magnitude} [Prop. 10.15].\nBut, {CD magnitude} is commensurable in length with {CD magnitude} plus {BF magnitude}.\nFor {CD magnitude} is equal to {BF magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].\nThus, {BC magnitude} is also commensurable in length with {BF magnitude} plus {CD magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nHence, {BC magnitude} is also commensurable in length with the remainder {FD magnitude} [Prop. 10.15].\nThus, the square on {BC magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {A magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({BC magnitude}).\n\nAnd so let the square on {BC magnitude} be greater than the (square on) {A magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({BC magnitude}).\nAnd let a (rectangle) equal to the fourth (part) of the (square) on {A magnitude}, falling short by a square figure, have been applied to {BC magnitude}.\nAnd let it be the (rectangle contained) by {BD magnitude} and {DC magnitude}.\nIt must be shown that {BD magnitude} is commensurable in length with {DC magnitude}.\n\nFor, similarly, by the same construction, we can show that the square on {BC magnitude} is greater than the (square on) {A magnitude} by the (square) on {FD magnitude}.\nAnd the square on {BC magnitude} is greater than the (square on) {A magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({BC magnitude}).\nThus, {BC magnitude} is commensurable in length with {FD magnitude}.\nHence, {BC magnitude} is also commensurable in length with the remaining sum of {BF magnitude} and {DC magnitude} [Prop. 10.15].\nBut, the sum of {BF magnitude} and {DC magnitude} is commensurable [in length] with {DC magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].\nHence, {BC magnitude} is also commensurable in length with {CD magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nThus, via separation, {BD magnitude} is also commensurable in length with {DC magnitude} [Prop. 10.15].\n\nThus, if there

    "prose": "A second bimedial (straight-line) can be divided (into its component terms) at one point only.\n\nLet {AB magnitude} be a second bimedial (straight-line) which has been divided at {C point}, so that {AC magnitude} and {BC magnitude} are medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area) [Prop. 10.38].\nSo, (it is) clear that {C point} is not (located) at the point of bisection, since ({AC magnitude} and {BC magnitude}) are not commensurable in length.\nI say that {AB magnitude} cannot be (so) divided at another point.\n\nFor, if possible, let it also have been (so) divided at {D point}, so that {AC magnitude} is not the same as {DB magnitude}, but {AC magnitude} (is), by hypothesis, greater.\nSo, (it is) clear that (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} is also less than (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, as we showed above [Prop. 10.41 lem.].\nAnd {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area).\nAnd let the rational (straight-line) {EF line} be laid down.\nAnd let the rectangular parallelogram {EK polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {EF line}.\nAnd let {EG polygon}, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, have been cut off (from {EK polygon}).\nThus, the remainder, {HK polygon}, is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 2.4].\nSo, again, let {EL polygon}, equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}---which was shown (to be) less than (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}---have been cut off (from {EK polygon}).\nAnd, thus, the remainder, {MK polygon}, (is) equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}.\nAnd since (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is medial, {EG polygon} (is) thus [also] medial.\nAnd it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF line}.\nThus, {EH line} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF line} [Prop. 10.22].\nSo, for the same (reasons), {HN line} is also rational, and incommensurable in length with {EF line}.\nAnd since {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, {AC magnitude} is thus incommensurable in length with {CB magnitude}.\nAnd as {AC magnitude} (is) to {CB magnitude}, so the (square) on {AC magnitude} (is) to the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.].\nThus, the (square) on {AC magnitude} is incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].\nBut, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {AC magnitude}.\nFor, {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are commensurable in square [Prop. 10.15].\nAnd twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].\nAnd thus (the sum of) the squares on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].\nBut, {EG polygon} is equal to (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}, and {HK polygon} equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}.\nThus, {EG polygon} is polygon incommensurable with {HK polygon}.\nHence, {EH line} is also incommensurable in length with {HN line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nAnd (they are) rational (straight-lines).\nThus, {EH line} and {HN line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nAnd if two rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only are added together then the whole (straight-line) is that irrational called binomial [Prop. 10.36].\nThus, {EN line} is a binomial (straightline) which has been divided (into its component terms) at {H point}.\nSo, according to the same (reasoning), {EM line} and {MN line} can be shown (to be) rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nAnd {EN line} will (thus) be a binomial (straight-line) which has been divided (into its component terms) at the different (points) {H point} and {M point} (which is absurd [Prop. 10.42]).\nAnd {EH line} is not the same as {MN line}, since (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is greater than (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}.\nBut, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} [Prop. 10.59 lem.].\nThus, (the sum of) the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}---that is to say, {EG polygon}---is also much greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}---that is to say, {MK polygon}.\nHence, {EH line} is also greater than {MN line} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, {EH line} is not the same as {MN line}.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

I].\nAnd let some rational straight-line {E magnitude} be laid down.\nAnd let it have been contrived that as {D magnitude} (is) to {AB magnitude}, so the (square) on {E magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].\nThus, the (square) on {E magnitude} (is) commensurable with the (square) on {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].\nAnd {E magnitude} is rational.\nThus, {FG magnitude} (is) also rational.\nAnd since {D magnitude} does not have to {AB magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {E magnitude} thus does not have to the (square) on {FG magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.\nThus, {E magnitude} (is) incommensurable in length with {FG magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].\nSo, again, let it have be contrived that as {BA magnitude} (is) to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.6 corr.].\nThe (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) thus commensurable with the (square) on {HG magnitude} [Prop. 10.6].\nThe (square) on {HG magnitude} (is) thus rational.\nThus, {HG magnitude} (is) rational.\nAnd since {BA magnitude} does not have to {AC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on {FG magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {GH magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.\nThus, {FG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].\nThus, {FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nThus, {FH magnitude} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].\nSo, we must show that (it is) also a sixth (binomial straight-line).\n\nFor since as {D magnitude} is to {AB magnitude}, so the (square) on {E magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FG magnitude}, and also as {BA magnitude} is to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude}, thus, via equality, as {D magnitude} is to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {E magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 5.22].\nAnd {D magnitude} does not have to {AC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.\nThus, the (square) on {E magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {GH magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.\n{E magnitude} is thus incommensurable in length with {GH magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].\nAnd ({E magnitude}) was also shown (to be) incommensurable (in length) with {FG magnitude}.\nThus, {FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} are each incommensurable in length with {E magnitude}.\nAnd since as {BA magnitude} is to {AC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {GH magnitude}, the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) thus greater than the (square) on {GH magnitude} [Prop. 5.14].\nTherefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on {GH magnitude} and {K magnitude} be equal to the (square) on {FG magnitude}.\nThus, via conversion, as {AB magnitude} (is) to {BC magnitude}, so the (square) on {FG magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {K magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].\nAnd {AB magnitude} does not have to {BC magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.\nHence, the (square) on {FG magnitude} does not have to the (square) on {K magnitude} the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either.\nThus, {FG magnitude} is incommensurable in length with {K magnitude} [Prop. 10.9].\nThe square on {FG magnitude} is thus greater than (the square on) {GH magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with ({FG magnitude}).\nAnd {FG magnitude} and {GH magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with the rational (straight-line) {E magnitude} (previously) laid down.\n\n Thus, {FH magnitude} is a sixth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.10].\n (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line which is) called binomial.\n\nFor let the area {AC polygon} be contained by the rational (straight-line) {AB line} and by the first binomial (straight-line) {AD line}.\nI say that square-root of area {AC polygon} is the irrational (straight-line which is) called binomial.\n\nFor since {AD line} is a first binomial (straight-line), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at {E point}, and let {AE line} be the greater term.\nSo, (it is) clear that {AE line} and {ED line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and that the square on {AE line} is greater than (the square on) {ED line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE line}), and that {AE line} is commensurable (in length) with the rational (straight-line) {AB line} (first) laid out [Def. 10.5].\nSo, let {ED line} have been cut in half at point {F point}.\nAnd since the square on {AE line} is greater than (the square on) {ED line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE line}), thus if a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser (term)---that is to say, the (square) on {EF line}---falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater (term) {AE line}, then it divides it into (terms which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].\nTherefore, let the (rectangle contained) by {AG line} and {GE line}, equal to the (square) on {EF line}, have been applied to {AE line}.\n{AG line} is thus commensurable in length with {EG line}.\nAnd let {GH line}, {EK line}, and {FL line} have been drawn from (points) {G point}, {E point}, and {F point} (respectively), parallel to either of {AB line} or {CD line}.\nAnd let the square {SN polygon}, equal to the parallelogram {AH polygon}, have been constructed, and (the square) {NQ polygon}, equal to (the parallelogram) {GK polygon} [Prop. 2.14].\nAnd let {MN line} be laid down so as to be straight-on to {NO line}.\n{RN line} is thus also straight-on to {NP line}.\nAnd let the parallelogram {SQ polygon} have been completed.\n{SQ polygon} is thus a square [Prop. 10.53 lem.].\nAnd since the (rectangle contained) by {AG line} and {GE line} is equal to the (square) on {EF line}, thus as {AG line} is to {EF line}, so {FE line} (is) to {EG line} [Prop. 6.17].\nAnd thus as {AH polygon} (is) to {EL polygon}, (so) {EL polygon} (is) to {KG polygon} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, {EL polygon} is the mean proportional to {AH polygon} and {GK polygon}.\nBut, {AH polygon} is equal to {SN polygon}, and {GK polygon} (is) equal to {NQ polygon}.\n{EL polygon} is thus the mean proportional to {SN polygon} and {NQ polygon}.\nAnd {MR polygon} is also the mean proportional to the same---(namely), {SN polygon} and {NQ polygon} [Prop. 10.53 lem.].\n{EL polygon} is thus equal to {MR polygon}.\nHence, it is also equal to {PO polygon} [Prop. 1.43].\nAnd {AH polygon} plus {GK polygon} is equal to {SN polygon} plus {NQ polygon}.\nThus, the whole of {AC polygon} is equal to the whole of {SQ polygon}---that is to say, to the square on {MO line}.\nThus, {MO line} (is) the square-root of (area) {AC polygon}.\nI say that {MO line} is a binomial (straight-line).\n\nFor since {AG line} is commensurable (in length) with {GE line}, {AE line} is also commensurable (in length) with each of {AG line} and {GE line} [Prop. 10.15].\nAnd {AE line} was also assumed (to be) commensurable (in length) with {AB line}.\nThus, {AG line} and {GE line} are also commensurable (in length) with {AB line} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd {AB line} is rational.\n{AG line} and {GE line} are thus each also rational.\nThus, {AH polygon} and {GK polygon} are each rational (areas), and {AH polygon} is commensurable with {GK polygon} [Prop. 10.19].\nBut, {AH polygon} is equal to {SN polygon}, and {GK polygon} to {NQ polygon}.\n{SN polygon} and {NQ polygon}---that is to say, the (squares) on {MN line} and {NO line} (respectively)---are thus also rational and commensurable.\nAnd since {AE line} is incommensurable in length with {ED line}, but {AE line} is commensurable (in length) with {AG line}, and {DE line} (is) commensurable (in length) with {EF line}, {AG line} (is) thus also incommensurable (in length) with {EF line} [Prop. 10.13].\nHence, {AH polygon} is also incommensurable with {EL polygon} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nBut, {AH polygon} is equal to {SN polygon}, and {EL polygon} to {MR polygon}.\nThus, {SN polygon} is also incommensurable with {MR polygon}.\nBut, as {SN polygon} (is) to {MR polygon}, (so) {PN line} (is) to {NR line} [Prop. 6.1].\n{PN line} is thus incommensurable (in length) with {NR line} [Prop. 10.11].\nAnd {PN line} (is) equal to {MN line}, and {NR line} to {NO line}.\nThus, {MN line} is incommensurable (in length) with {NO line}.\nAnd the (square) on {MN line} is commensurable with the (square) on {NO line}, and each (is) rational.\n{MN line} and {NO line} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\n\nThus, {MO line} is (both) a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36], and the square-root of {AC polygon}.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a second binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line which is) called first bimedial.\n\nFor let the area {ABCD polygon} be contained by the rational (straight-line) {AB line} and by the second binomial (straight-line) {AD line}.\nI say that the square-root of area {AC polygon} is a first bimedial(straight-line).\n\nFor since {AD line} is a second binomial (straight-line), let it have been divided into its (component) terms at {E point}, such that {AE line} is the greater term.\nThus, {AE line} and {ED line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the square on {AE line} is greater than (the square on) {ED line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AE line}), and the lesser term {ED line} is commensurable in length with {AB line} [Def. 10.6].\nLet {ED line} have been cut in half at {F point}.\nAnd let the (rectangle contained) by {AG line} and {GE line}, equal to the (square) on {EF line}, have been applied to {AE line}, falling short by a square figure.\n{AG line} (is) thus commensurable in length with {GE line} [Prop. 10.17].\nAnd let {GH line}, {EK line}, and {FL line} have been drawn through (points) {G point}, {E point}, and {F point} (respectively), parallel to {AB line} and {CD line}.\nAnd let the square {SN polygon}, equal to the parallelogram {AH polygon}, have been constructed, and the square {NQ polygon}, equal to {GK polygon}.\nAnd let {MN line} be laid down so as to be straight-on to {NO line}.\nThus, {RN line} [is] also straight-on to {NP line}.\nAnd let the square {SQ polygon} have been completed.\nSo, (it is) clear from what has been previously demonstrated [Prop. 10.53 lem.] that {MR polygon} is the mean proportional to {SN polygon} and {NQ polygon}, and (is) equal to {EL polygon}, and that {MO line} is the square-root of the area {AC polygon}.\nSo, we must show that {MO line} is a first bimedial (straight-line).\n\nSince {AE line} is incommensurable in length with {ED line}, and {ED line} (is) commensurable (in length) with {AB line}, {AE line} (is) thus incommensurable (in length) with {AB line} [Prop. 10.13].\nAnd since {AG line} is commensurable (in length) with {EG line}, {AE line} is also commensurable (in length) with each of {AG line} and {GE line} [Prop. 10.15].\nBut, {AE line} is incommensurable in length with {AB line}.\nThus, {AG line} and {GE line} are also (both) incommensurable (in length) with {AB line} [Prop. 10.13].\nThus, {BA line}, {AG line}, and ({BA line}, and) {GE line} are (pairs of) rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nAnd, hence, each of {AH polygon} and {GK polygon} is a medial (area) [Prop. 10.21].\nHence, each of {SN polygon} and {NQ polygon} is also a medial (area).\nThus, {MN line} and {NO line} are medial (straight-lines).\nAnd since {AG line} (is) commensurable in length with {GE line}, {AH polygon} is also commensurable with {GK polygon} ---that is to say, {SN polygon} with {NQ polygon}---that is to say, the (square) on {MN line} with the (square) on {NO line} [hence, {MN line} and {NO line} are commensurable in square] [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nAnd since {AE line} is incommensurable in length with {ED line}, but {AE line} is commensurable (in length) with {AG line}, and {ED line} commensurable (in length) with {EF line}, {AG line} (is) thus incommensurable (in length) with {EF line} [Prop. 10.13].\nHence, {AH polygon} is also incommensurable with {EL polygon}---that is to say, {SN polygon} with {MR polygon}---that is to say, {PN line} with {NR line}---that is to say, {MN line} is incommensurable in length with {NO line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nBut {MN line} and {NO line} have also been shown to be medial (straight-lines) which are commensurable in square.\nThus, {MN line} and {NO line} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nSo, I say that they also contain a rational (area).\nFor since {DE line} was assumed (to be) commensurable (in length) with each of {AB line} and {EF line}, {EF line} (is) thus also commensurable with {EK line} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd they (are) each rational.\nThus, {EL polygon}---that is to say, {MR polygon}---(is) rational [Prop. 10.19].\nAnd {MR polygon} is the (rectangle contained) by {MN line} and {NO line}.\nAnd if two medial (straight-lines), commensurable in square only, which contain a rational (area), are added together, then the whole is (that) irrational (straight-line which is) called first bimedial [Prop. 10.37].\n\nThus, {MO line} is a first bimedial (straight-line).\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "The square on a binomial (straight-line) applied to a rational (straight-line) produces as breadth a first binomial (straight-line).\n\nLet {AB magnitude} be a binomial (straight-line), having been divided into its (component) terms at {C point}, such that {AC magnitude} is the greater term.\nAnd let the rational (straight-line) {DE line} be laid down.\nAnd let the (rectangle) {DEFG polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {DE line}, producing {DG line} as breadth.\nI say that {DG line} is a first binomial (straight-line).\n\nFor let {DH polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AC magnitude}, and {KL polygon}, equal to the (square) on {BC magnitude}, have been applied to {DE line}.\nThus, the remaining twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is equal to {MF polygon} [Prop. 2.4].\nLet {MG line} have been cut in half at {N point}, and let {NO line} have been drawn parallel [to each of {ML line} and {GF line}].\n{MO polygon} and {NF polygon} are thus each equal to once the (rectangle contained) by {ACB magnitude}.\nAnd since {AB magnitude} is a binomial (straight-line), having been divided into its (component) terms at {C point}, {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.36].\nThus, the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are rational, and commensurable with one another.\nAnd hence the sum of the (squares) on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} (is rational) [Prop. 10.15], and is equal to {DL polygon}.\nThus, {DL polygon} is rational.\nAnd it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {DE line}.\n{DM line} is thus rational, and commensurable in length with {DE line} [Prop. 10.20].\nAgain, since {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude}---that is to say, {MF polygon}---is thus medial [Prop. 10.21].\nAnd it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {ML line}.\n{MG line} is thus also rational, and incommensurable in length with {ML line}---that is to say, with {DE line} [Prop. 10.22].\nAnd {MD line} is also rational, and commensurable in length with {DE line}.\nThus, {DM line} is incommensurable in length with {MG line} [Prop. 10.13].\nAnd they are rational.\n{DM line} and {MG line} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nThus, {DG line} is a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].\nSo, we must show that (it is) also a first (binomial straight-line).\n\nSince the (rectangle contained) by {ACB magnitude} is the mean proportional to the squares on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.53 lem.], {MO polygon} is thus also the mean proportional to {DH polygon} and {KL polygon}.\nThus, as {DH polygon} is to {MO polygon}, so {MO polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}---that is to say, as {DK line} (is) to {MN line}, (so) {MN line} (is) to {MK line} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, the (rectangle contained) by {DK line} and {KM line} is equal to the (square) on {MN line} [Prop. 6.17].\nAnd since the (square) on {AC magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {CB magnitude}, {DH polygon} is also commensurable with {KL polygon}.\nHence, {DK line} is also commensurable with {KM line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nAnd since (the sum of) the squares on {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} is greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by {AC magnitude} and {CB magnitude} [Prop. 10.59 lem.], {DL polygon} (is) thus also greater than {MF polygon}.\nHence, {DM line} is also greater than {MG line} [Props. 6.1, 5.14].\nAnd the (rectangle contained) by {DK line} and {KM line} is equal to the (square) on {MN line}---that is to say, to one quarter the (square) on {MG line}.\nAnd {DK line} (is) commensurable (in length) with {KM line}.\nAnd if there are two unequal straight-lines, and a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts which are) commensurable (in length), then the square on the greater is larger than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the greater [Prop. 10.17].\nThus, the square on {DM line} is greater than (the square on) {MG line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({DM line}).\nAnd {DM line} and {MG line} are rational.\nAnd {DM line}, which is the greater term, is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {DE line}.\n\nThus, {DG line} is a first binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.5].\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "When two medial (areas which are) incommensurable with one another are added together, the remaining two irrational (straight-lines) arise (as the square-roots of the total area)---either a second bimedial, or the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).\n\nFor let the two medial (areas) {AB polygon} and {CD polygon}, (which are) incommensurable with one another, have been added together.\nI say that the square-root of area {AD polygon} is either a second bimedial, or the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).\n\nFor {AB polygon} is either greater than or less than {CD polygon}.\nBy chance, let {AB polygon}, first of all, be greater than {CD polygon}.\nAnd let the rational (straight-line) {EF line} be laid down.\nAnd let {EG polygon}, equal to {AB polygon}, have been applied to {EF line}, producing {EH line} as breadth, and {HI polygon}, equal to {CD polygon}, producing {HK line} as breadth.\nAnd since {AB polygon} and {CD polygon} are each medial, {EG polygon} and {HI polygon} (are) thus also each medial.\nAnd they are applied to the rational straight-line {FE line}, producing {EH line} and {HK line} (respectively) as breadth.\nThus, {EH line} and {HK line} are each rational (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in length with {EF line} [Prop. 10.22].\nAnd since {AB polygon} is incommensurable with {CD polygon}, and {AB polygon} is equal to {EG polygon}, and {CD polygon} to {HI polygon}, {EG polygon} is thus also incommensurable with {HI polygon}.\nAnd as {EG polygon} (is) to {HI polygon}, so {EH line} is to {HK line} [Prop. 6.1].\nEHis thus incommensurable in length with {HK line} [Prop. 10.11].\nThus, {EH line} and {HK line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\n{EK line} is thus a binomial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.36].\nAnd the square on {EH line} is greater than (the square on) {HK line} either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({EH line}), or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length with {EH line}).\nLet it, first of all, be greater by the square on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({EH line}).\nAnd neither of {EH line} or {HK line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {EF line}.\nThus, {EK line} is a third binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.7].\nAnd {EF line} (is) rational.\nAnd if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a third binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is a second bimedial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.56].\nThus, the square-root of {EI polygon}---that is to say, of {AD polygon}---is a second bimedial.\nAnd so, let the square on {EH line} be greater than (the square) on {HK line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with ({EH line}).\nAnd {EH line} and {HK line} are each incommensurable in length with {EF line}.\nThus, {EK line} is a sixth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.10].\nAnd if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a sixth binomial (straight-line) then the square-root of the area is the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas) [Prop. 10.59].\nHence, the square-root of area {AD polygon} is also the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).\n\n[So, similarly, we can show that, even if {AB polygon} is less than {CD polygon}, the square-root of area {AD polygon} is either a second bimedial or the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).]\n\nThus, when two medial (areas which are) incommensurable with one another are added together, the remaining two irrational (straight-lines) arise (as the square-roots of the total area)---either a second bimedial, or the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas).\n\nA binomial (straight-line), and the (other) irrational (straight-lines) after it, are neither the same as a medial (straight-line) nor (the same) as one another.\nFor the (square) on a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a rational (straight-line which is) also incommensurable in length with (the straight-line) to which it is applied [Prop. 10.22].\nAnd the (square) on a binomial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a first binomial [Prop. 10.60].\nAnd the (square) on a first bimedial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a second binomial [Prop. 10.61].\nAnd the (square) on a second bimedial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a third binomial [Prop. 10.62].\nAnd the (square) on a major (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a fourth binomial [Prop. 10.63].\nAnd the (square) on the square-root of a rational plus a medial (area), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a fifth binomial [Prop. 10.64].\nAnd the (square) on the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a sixth binomial [Prop. 10.65].\nAnd the aforementioned breadths differ from the first (breadth), and from one another---from the first, because it is rational---and from one another, because they are not the same in order.\nHence, the (previously mentioned) irrational (straight-lines) themselves also differ from one another.\n",

    "prose": "If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a first apotome then the square-root of the area is an apotome.\n\nFor let the area {AB polygon} have been contained by the rational (straight-line) {AC line} and the first apotome {AD line}.\nI say that the square-root of area {AB polygon} is an apotome.\n\nFor since {AD line} is a first apotome, let {DG line} be its attachment.\nThus, {AG line} and {DG line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].\nAnd the whole, {AG line}, is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {AC line}, and the square on {AG line} is greater than (the square on) {GD line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({AG line}) [Def. 10.11].\nThus, if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {DG line} is applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure, then it divides ({AG line}) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].\nLet {DG line} have been cut in half at {E point}.\nAnd let (an area) equal to the (square) on {EG line} have been applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure.\nAnd let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF line} and {FG line}.\n{AF line} is thus commensurable (in length) with {FG line}.\nAnd let {EH line}, {FI line}, and {GK line} have been drawn through points {E point}, {F point}, and {G point} (respectively), parallel to {AC line}.\n\nAnd since {AF line} is commensurable in length with {FG line}, {AG line} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {AF line} and {FG line} [Prop. 10.15].\nBut {AG line} is commensurable (in length) with {AC line}.\nThus, each of {AF line} and {FG line} is also commensurable in length with {AC line} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd {AC line} is a rational (straight-line).\nThus, {AF line} and {FG line} (are) each also rational (straight-lines).\nHence, {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} are also each rational (areas) [Prop. 10.19].\nAnd since {DE line} is commensurable in length with {EG line}, {DG line} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {DE line} and {EG line} [Prop. 10.15].\nAnd {DG line} (is) rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC line}.\n{DE line} and {EG line} (are) thus each rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC line} [Prop. 10.13].\nThus, {DH polygon} and {EK polygon} are each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].\n\nSo let the square {LM polygon}, equal to {AI polygon}, be laid down.\nAnd let the square {NO polygon}, equal to {FK polygon}, have been subtracted (from {LM polygon}), having with it the common angle {LPM angle}.\nThus, the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].\nLet {PR line} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.\nTherefore, since the rectangle contained by {AF line} and {FG line} is equal to the square {EG line}, thus as {AF line} is to {EG line}, so {EG line} (is) to {FG line} [Prop. 6.17].\nBut, as {AF line} (is) to {EG line}, so {AI polygon} (is) to {EK polygon}, and as {EG line} (is) to {FG line}, so {EK polygon} is to {KF polygon} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, {EK polygon} is the mean proportional to {AI polygon} and {KF polygon} [Prop. 5.11].\nAnd {MN polygon} is also the mean proportional to {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}, as shown before [Prop. 10.53 lem.].\nAnd {AI polygon} is equal to the square {LM polygon}, and {KF polygon} to {NO polygon}.\nThus, {MN polygon} is also equal to {EK polygon}.\nBut, {EK polygon} is equal to {DH polygon}, and {MN polygon} to {LO polygon} [Prop. 1.43].\nThus, {DK polygon} is equal to the gnomon {UVW given} and {NO polygon}.\nAnd {AK polygon} is also equal to (the sum of) the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}.\nThus, the remainder {AB polygon} is equal to {ST polygon}.\nAnd {ST polygon} is the square on {LN line}.\nThus, the square on {LN line} is equal to {AB polygon}.\nThus, {LN line} is the square-root of {AB polygon}.\nSo, I say that {LN line} is an apotome.\n\nFor since {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} are each rational (areas), and are equal to {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} (respectively), thus {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}---that is to say, the (squares) on each of {LP line} and {PN line} (respectively)---are also each rational (areas).\nThus, {LP line} and {PN line} are also each rational (straight-lines).\nAgain, since {DH polygon} is a medial (area), and is equal to {LO polygon}, {LO polygon} is thus also a medial (area).\nTherefore, since {LO polygon} is medial, and {NO polygon} rational, {LO polygon} is thus incommensurable with {NO polygon}.\nAnd as {LO polygon} (is) to {NO polygon}, so {LP line} is to {PN line} [Prop. 6.1].\n{LP line} is thus incommensurable in length with {PN line} [Prop. 10.11].\nAnd they are both rational (straight-lines).\nThus, {LP line} and {PN line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nThus, {LN line} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].\nAnd it is the square-root of area {AB polygon}.\nThus, the square-root of area {AB polygon} is an apotome.\n\nThus, if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line), and so on ....\n",

by a square figure, then it divides ({AG line}) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].\nTherefore, let {DG line} have been cut in half at {E point}.\nAnd let (an area) equal to the (square) on {EG line} have been applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure.\nAnd let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF line} and {FG line}.\nThus, {AF line} is commensurable in length with {FG line}.\n{AG line} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {AF line} and {FG line} [Prop. 10.15].\nAnd {AG line} (is) a rational (straight-line), and incommensurable in length with {AC line}.\n{AF line} and {FG line} are thus also each rational (straight-lines), and incommensurable in length with {AC line} [Prop. 10.13].\nThus, {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} are each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].\nAgain, since {DE line} is commensurable (in length) with {EG line}, thus {DG line} is also commensurable (in length) with each of {DE line} and {EG line} [Prop. 10.15].\nBut, {DG line} is commensurable in length with {AC line} [thus, {DE line} and {EG line} are also each rational, and commensurable in length with {AC line}].\nThus, {DH polygon} and {EK polygon} are each rational (areas) [Prop. 10.19].\n\nTherefore, let the square {LM polygon}, equal to {AI polygon}, have been constructed.\nAnd let {NO polygon}, equal to {FK polygon}, which is about the same angle {LPM angle} as {LM polygon}, have been subtracted (from {LM polygon}).\nThus, the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].\nLet {PR line} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.\nTherefore, since {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} are medial (areas), and are equal to the (squares) on {LP line} and {PN line} (respectively), [thus] the (squares) on {LP line} and {PN line} are also medial.\nThus, {LP line} and {PN line} are also medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nAnd since the (rectangle contained) by {AF line} and {FG line} is equal to the (square) on {EG line}, thus as {AF line} is to {EG line}, so {EG line} (is) to {FG line} [Prop. 10.17].\nBut, as {AF line} (is) to {EG line}, so {AI polygon} (is) to {EK polygon}.\nAnd as {EG line} (is) to {FG line}, so {EK polygon} [is] to {FK polygon} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, {EK polygon} is the mean proportional to {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} [Prop. 5.11].\nAnd {MN polygon} is also the mean proportional to the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} [Prop. 10.53 lem.].\nAnd {AI polygon} is equal to {LM polygon}, and {FK polygon} to {NO polygon}.\nThus, {MN polygon} is also equal to {EK polygon}.\nBut, {DH polygon} [is] equal to {EK polygon}, and {LO polygon} equal to {MN polygon} [Prop. 1.43].\nThus, the whole (of) {DK polygon} is equal to the gnomon {UVW given} and {NO polygon}.\nTherefore, since the whole (of) {AK polygon} is equal to {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}, of which {DK polygon} is equal to the gnomon {UVW given} and {NO polygon}, the remainder {AB polygon} is thus equal to {TS polygon}.\nAnd {TS polygon} is the (square) on {LN line}.\nThus, the (square) on {LN line} is equal to the area {AB polygon}.\n{LN line} is thus the square-root of area {AB polygon}.\n[So], I say that {LN line} is the first apotome of a medial (straight-line).\n\nFor since {EK polygon} is a rational (area), and is equal to {LO polygon}, {LO polygon}---that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by {LP line} and {PN line}---is thus a rational (area).\nAnd {NO polygon} was shown (to be) a medial (area).\nThus, {LO polygon} is incommensurable with {NO polygon}.\nAnd as {LO polygon} (is) to {NO polygon}, so {LP line} is to {PN line} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, {LP line} and {PN line} are incommensurable in length [Prop. 10.11].\n{LP line} and {PN line} are thus medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and which contain a rational (area).\nThus, {LN line} is the first apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.74].\nAnd it is the square-root of area {AB polygon}.\n\nThus, the square root of area {AB polygon} is the first apotome of a medial (straight-line).\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a third apotome then the square-root of the area is a second apotome of a medial (straight-line).\n\nFor let the area {AB polygon} have been contained by the rational (straight-line) {AC line} and the third apotome {AD line}.\nI say that the square-root of area {AB polygon} is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line).\n\nFor let {DG line} be an attachment to {AD line}.\nThus, {AG line} and {GD line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73], and neither of {AG line} and {GD line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {AC line}, and the square on the whole, {AG line}, is greater than (the square on) the attachment, {DG line}, by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AG line}) [Def. 10.13].\nTherefore, since the square on {AG line} is greater than (the square on) {GD line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({AG line}), thus if (an area) equal to the fourth part of the square on {DG line} is applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure, then it divides ({AG line}) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.17].\nTherefore, let {DG line} have been cut in half at {E point}.\nAnd let (an area) equal to the (square) on {EG line} have been applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure.\nAnd let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF line} and {FG line}.\nAnd let {EH line}, {FI line}, and {GK line} have been drawn through points {E point}, {F point}, and {G point} (respectively), parallel to {AC line}.\nThus, {AF line} and {FG line} are commensurable (in length).\n{AI polygon} (is) thus also commensurable with {FK polygon} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nAnd since {AF line} and {FG line} are commensurable in length, {AG line} is thus also commensurable in length with each of {AF line} and {FG line} [Prop. 10.15].\nAnd {AG line} (is) rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC line}.\nHence, {AF line} and {FG line} (are) also (rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC line}) [Prop. 10.13].\nThus, {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} are each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].\nAgain, since {DE line} is commensurable in length with {EG line}, {DG line} is also commensurable in length with each of {DE line} and {EG line} [Prop. 10.15].\nAnd {GD line} (is) rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC line}.\nThus, {DE line} and {EG line} (are) each also rational, and incommensurable in length with {AC line} [Prop. 10.13].\n{DH polygon} and {EK polygon} are thus each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21].\nAnd since {AG line} and {GD line} are commensurable in square only, {AG line} is thus incommensurable in length with {GD line}.\nBut, {AG line} is commensurable in length with {AF line}, and {DG line} with {EG line}.\nThus, {AF line} is incommensurable in length with {EG line} [Prop. 10.13].\nAnd as {AF line} (is) to {EG line}, so {AI polygon} is to {EK polygon} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, {AI polygon} is incommensurable with {EK polygon} [Prop. 10.11].\n\nTherefore, let the square {LM polygon}, equal to {AI polygon}, have been constructed.\nAnd let {NO polygon}, equal to {FK polygon}, which is about the same angle as {LM polygon}, have been subtracted (from {LM polygon}).\nThus, {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].\nLet {PR line} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.\nTherefore, since the (rectangle contained) by {AF line} and {FG line} is equal to the (square) on {EG line}, thus as {AF line} is to {EG line}, so {EG line} (is) to {FG line} [Prop. 6.17].\nBut, as {AF line} (is) to {EG line}, so {AI polygon} is to {EK polygon} [Prop.6.1].\nAnd as {EG line} (is) to {FG line}, so {EK polygon} is to {FK polygon} [Prop. 6.1].\nAnd thus as {AI polygon} (is) to {EK polygon}, so {EK polygon} (is) to {FK polygon} [Prop. 5.11].\nThus, {EK polygon} is the mean proportional to {AI polygon} and {FK polygon}.\nAnd {MN polygon} is also the mean proportional to the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} [Prop. 10.53 lem.].\nAnd {AI polygon} is equal to {LM polygon}, and {FK polygon} to {NO polygon}.\nThus, {EK polygon} is also equal to {MN polygon}.\nBut, {MN polygon} is equal to {LO polygon}, and {EK polygon} [is] equal to {DH polygon} [Prop. 1.43].\nAnd thus the whole of {DK polygon} is equal to the gnomon {UVW given} and {NO polygon}.\nAnd {AK polygon} (is) also equal to {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}.\nThus, the remainder {AB polygon} is equal to {ST polygon}---that is to say, to the square on {LN line}.\nThus, {LN line} is the square-root of area {AB polygon}.\nI say that {LN line} is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line).\n\nFor since {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} were shown (to be) medial (areas), and are equal to the (squares) on {LP line} and {PN line} (respectively), the (squares) on each of {LP line} and {PN line} (are) thus also medial.\nThus, {LP line} and {PN line} (are) each medial (straight-lines).\nAnd since {AI polygon} is commensurable with {FK polygon} [Props. 6.1, 10.11], the (square) on {LP line} (is) thus also commensurable with the (square) on {PN line}.\nAgain, since {AI polygon} was shown (to be) incommensurable with {EK polygon}, {LM polygon} is thus also incommensurable with {MN polygon}---that is to say, the (square) on {LP line} with the (rectangle contained) by {LP line} and {PN line}.\nHence, {LP line} is also incommensurable in length with {PN line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nThus, {LP line} and {PN line} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nSo, I say that they also contain a medial (area).\n\nFor since {EK polygon} was shown (to be) a medial (area), and is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {LP line} and {PN line}, the (rectangle contained) by {LP line} and {PN line} is thus also medial.\nHence, {LP line} and {PN line} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and which contain a medial (area).\nThus, {LN line} is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.75].\nAnd it is the square-root of area {AB polygon}.\n\nThus, the square-root of area {AB polygon} is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line).\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "If an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fourth apotome then the square-root of the area is a minor (straight-line).\n\nFor let the area {AB polygon} have been contained by the rational (straight-line) {AC line} and the fourth apotome {AD line}.\nI say that the square-root of area {AB polygon} is a minor (straight-line).\nFor let {DG line} be an attachment to {AD line}.\nThus, {AG line} and {DG line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73], and {AG line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {AC line}, and the square on the whole, {AG line}, is greater than (the square on) the attachment, {DG line}, by the square on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with ({AG line}) [Def. 10.14].\nTherefore, since the square on {AG line} is greater than (the square on) {GD line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with ({AG line}), thus if (some area), equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {DG line}, is applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure, then it divides ({AG line}) into (parts which are) incommensurable (in length) [Prop. 10.18].\nTherefore, let {DG line} have been cut in half at {E point}, and let (some area), equal to the (square) on {EG line}, have been applied to {AG line}, falling short by a square figure, and let it be the (rectangle contained) by {AF line} and {FG line}.\nThus, {AF line} is incommensurable in length with {FG line}.\nTherefore, let {EH line}, {FI line}, and {GK line} have been drawn through {E point}, {F point}, and {G point} (respectively), parallel to {AC line} and {BD line}.\nTherefore, since {AG line} is rational, and commensurable in length with {AC line}, the whole (area) {AK polygon} is thus rational [Prop. 10.19].\nAgain, since {DG line} is incommensurable in length with {AC line}, and both are rational (straight-lines), {DK polygon} is thus a medial (area) [Prop. 10.21].\nAgain, since {AF line} is incommensurable in length with {FG line}, {AI polygon} (is) thus also incommensurable with {FK polygon} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\n\nTherefore, let the square {LM polygon}, equal to {AI polygon}, have been constructed.\nAnd let {NO polygon}, equal to {FK polygon}, (and) about the same angle, {LPM angle}, have been subtracted (from {LM polygon}).\nThus, the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} are about the same diagonal [Prop. 6.26].\nLet {PR line} be their (common) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn.\nTherefore, since the (rectangle contained) by {AF line} and {FG line} is equal to the (square) on {EG line}, thus, proportionally, as {AF line} is to {EG line}, so {EG line} (is) to {FG line} [Prop. 6.17].\nBut, as {AF line} (is) to {EG line}, so {AI polygon} is to {EK polygon}, and as {EG line} (is) to {FG line}, so {EK polygon} is to {FK polygon} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, {EK polygon} is the mean proportional to {AI polygon} and {FK polygon} [Prop. 5.11].\nAnd {MN polygon} is also the mean proportional to the squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon} [Prop. 10.13 lem.], and {AI polygon} is equal to {LM polygon}, and {FK polygon} to {NO polygon}.\n{EK polygon} is thus also equal to {MN polygon}.\nBut, {DH polygon} is equal to {EK polygon}, and {LO polygon} is equal to {MN polygon} [Prop. 1.43].\nThus, the whole of {DK polygon} is equal to the gnomon {UVW given} and {NO polygon}.\nTherefore, since the whole of {AK polygon} is equal to the (sum of the) squares {LM polygon} and {NO polygon}, of which {DK polygon} is equal to the gnomon {UVW given} and the square {NO polygon}, the remainder {AB polygon} is thus equal to {ST polygon}---that is to say, to the square on {LN line}.\nThus, {LN line} is the square-root of area {AB polygon}.\nI say that {LN line} is the irrational (straight-line which is) called minor.\n\nFor since {AK polygon} is rational, and is equal to the (sum of the) squares {LP line} and {PN line}, the sum of the (squares) on {LP line} and {PN line} is thus rational.\nAgain, since {DK polygon} is medial, and {DK polygon} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {LP line} and {PN line}, thus twice the (rectangle contained) by {LP line} and {PN line} is medial.\nAnd since {AI polygon} was shown (to be) incommensurable with {FK polygon}, the square on {LP line} (is) thus also incommensurable with the square on {PN line}.\nThus, {LP line} and {PN line} are (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in square, making the sum of the squares on them rational, and twice the (rectangle contained) by them medial.\n{LN line} is thus the irrational (straight-line) called minor [Prop. 10.76].\nAnd it is the square-root of area {AB polygon}.\n\nThus, the square-root of area {AB polygon} is a minor (straight-line).\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

    "prose": "The (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a first apotome as breadth.\n\nLet {AB magnitude} be an apotome, and {CD line} a rational (straight-line).\nAnd let {CE polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {CF line} as breadth.\nI say that {CF line} is a first apotome.\n\nFor let {BG magnitude} be an attachment to {AB magnitude}.\nThus, {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].\nAnd let {CH polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, and {KL polygon}, (equal) to the (square) on {BG magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}.\nThus, the whole of {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, of which {CE polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}.\nThe remainder {FL polygon} is thus equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].\nLet {FM line} have been cut in half at point {N point}.\nAnd let {NO line} have been drawn through {N point}, parallel to {CD line}.\nThus, {FO polygon} and {LN polygon} are each equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.\nAnd since the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is rational, and {DM polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, {DM polygon} is thus rational.\nAnd it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD line}, producing {CM line} as breadth.\nThus, {CM line} is rational, and commensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.20].\nAgain, since twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is medial, and {FL polygon} (is) equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, {FL polygon} (is) thus a medial (area).\nAnd it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD line}, producing {FM line} as breadth.\n{FM line} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.22].\nAnd since the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is rational, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} medial, the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.\nAnd {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, and {FL polygon} to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.\n{DM polygon} is thus incommensurable with {FL polygon}.\nAnd as {DM polygon} (is) to {FL polygon}, so {CM line} is to {FM line} [Prop. 6.1].\n{CM line} is thus incommensurable in length with {FM line} [Prop. 10.11].\nAnd both are rational (straight-lines).\nThus, {CM line} and {MF line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\n{CF line} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73].\nSo, I say that (it is) also a first (apotome).\n\nFor since the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is the mean proportional to the (squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and {CH polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, and {KL polygon} equal to the (square) on {BG magnitude}, and {NL polygon} to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, {NL polygon} is thus also the mean proportional to {CH polygon} and {KL polygon}.\nThus, as {CH polygon} is to {NL polygon}, so {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}.\nBut, as {CH polygon} (is) to {NL polygon}, so {CK line} is to {NM line}, and as {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}, so {NM line} is to {KM line} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, the (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line} is equal to the (square) on {NM line}---that is to say, to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM line} [Prop. 6.17].\nAnd since the (square) on {AG magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {GB magnitude}, {CH polygon} [is] also commensurable with {KL polygon}.\nAnd as {CH polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}, so {CK line} (is) to {KM line} [Prop. 6.1].\n{CK line} is thus commensurable (in length) with {KM line} [Prop. 10.11].\nTherefore, since {CM line} and {MF line} are two unequal straight-lines, and the (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line}, equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM line}, has been applied to {CM line}, falling short by a square figure, and {CK line} is commensurable (in length) with {KM line}, the square on {CM line} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable in length with ({CM line}) [Prop. 10.17].\nAnd {CM line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD line}.\nThus, {CF line} is a first apotome [Def. 10.15].\n\nThus, the (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a first apotome as breadth.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

medial (straight-line), and {CD line} a rational (straight-line).\nAnd let {CE polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {CF line} as breadth.\nI say that {CF line} is a third apotome.\n\nFor let {BG magnitude} be an attachment to {AB magnitude}.\nThus, {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, containing a medial (area) [Prop. 10.75].\nAnd let {CH polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {CK line} as breadth.\nAnd let {KL polygon}, equal to the (square) on {BG magnitude}, have been applied to {KH line}, producing {KM line} as breadth.\nThus, the whole of {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [and the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is medial].\n{CL polygon} (is) thus also medial [Props. 10.15, 10.23 corr.].\nAnd it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {CD line}, producing {CM line} as breadth.\nThus, {CM line} is rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.22].\nAnd since the whole of {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, of which {CE polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, the remainder {LF polygon} is thus equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 2.7].\nTherefore, let {FM line} have been cut in half at point {N point}.\nAnd let {NO line} have been drawn parallel to {CD line}.\nThus, {FO polygon} and {NL polygon} are each equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.\nAnd the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} (is) medial.\nThus, {FL polygon} is also medial.\nAnd it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {EF line}, producing {FM line} as breadth.\n{FM line} is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with {CD line} [Prop. 10.22].\nAnd since {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} are commensurable in square only, {AG magnitude} [is] thus incommensurable in length with {GB magnitude}.\nThus, the (square) on {AG magnitude} is also incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nBut, the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {AG magnitude}, and twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} with the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.\nThe (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is thus incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].\nBut, {CL polygon} is equal to the (sum of the squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, and {FL polygon} is equal to twice the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}.\nThus, {CL polygon} is incommensurable with {FL polygon}.\nAnd as {CL polygon} (is) to {FL polygon}, so {CM line} is to {FM line} [Prop. 6.1].\n{CM line} is thus incommensurable in length with {FM line} [Prop. 10.11].\nAnd they are both rational (straight-lines).\nThus, {CM line} and {MF line} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\n{CF line} is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73].\nSo, I say that (it is) also a third (apotome).\n\nFor since the (square) on {AG magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {GB magnitude}, {CH polygon} (is) thus also commensurable with {KL polygon}.\nHence, {CK line} (is) also (commensurable in length) with {KM line} [Props. 6.1, 10.11].\nAnd since the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} is the mean proportional to the (squares) on {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude} [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and {CH polygon} is equal to the (square) on {AG magnitude}, and {KL polygon} equal to the (square) on {GB magnitude}, and {NL polygon} equal to the (rectangle contained) by {AG magnitude} and {GB magnitude}, {NL polygon} is thus also the mean proportional to {CH polygon} and {KL polygon}.\nThus, as {CH polygon} is to {NL polygon}, so {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}.\nBut, as {CH polygon} (is) to {NL polygon}, so {CK line} is to {NM line}, and as {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}, so {NM line} (is) to {KM line} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, as {CK line} (is) to {MN line}, so {MN line} is to {KM line} [Prop. 5.11].\nThus, the (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line} is equal to the [(square) on {MN line}---that is to say, to the] fourth part of the (square) on {FM line} [Prop. 6.17].\nTherefore, since {CM line} and {MF line} are two unequal straight-lines, and (some area), equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM line}, has been applied to {CM line}, falling short by a square figure, and divides it into commensurable (parts), the square on {CM line} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({CM line}) [Prop. 10.17].\nAnd neither of {CM line} and {MF line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD line}.\n{CF line} is thus a third apotome [Def. 10.13].\n\nThus, the (square) on a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a third apotome as breadth.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

polygon}, {NL polygon} is thus the mean proportional to {CH polygon} and {KL polygon}.\nThus, as {CH polygon} is to {NL polygon}, so {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}.\nBut, as {CH polygon} (is) to {NL polygon}, so {CK line} is to {NM line}, and as {NL polygon} (is) to {KL polygon}, so {NM line} is to {KM line} [Prop. 6.1].\nThus, as {CK line} (is) to {MN line}, so {MN line} is to {KM line} [Prop. 5.11].\nThe (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line} is thus equal to the (square) on {MN line}---that is to say, to the fourth part of the (square) on {FM line} [Prop. 6.17].\nTherefore, since {CM line} and {MF line} are two unequal straight-lines, and the (rectangle contained) by {CK line} and {KM line}, equal to the fourth part of the (square) on {MF line}, has been applied to {CM line}, falling short by a square figure, and divides it into incommensurable (parts), the square on {CM line} is thus greater than (the square on) {MF line} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({CM line}) [Prop. 10.18].\nAnd the whole of {CM line} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {CD line}.\nThus, {CF line} is a fourth apotome [Def. 10.14].\n\nThus, the (square) on a minor, and so on ...\n",

let a rational (straight-line) {DC line} be laid down.\nAnd let the rectangle {CE polygon}, equal to the (square) on {AB magnitude}, have been applied to {CD line}, producing {DE magnitude} as breadth.\nTherefore, since {AB magnitude} is an apotome, {DE magnitude} is a first apotome [Prop. 10.97].\nLet {EF magnitude} be an attachment to it.\nThus, {DF magnitude} and {FE magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the square on {DF magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {FE magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({DF magnitude}), and {DF magnitude} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {DC line} [Def. 10.10].\nAgain, since {AB magnitude} is a binomial, {DE magnitude} is thus a first binomial [Prop. 10.60].\nLet ({DE magnitude}) have been divided into its (component) terms at {G point}, and let {DG magnitude} be the greater term.\nThus, {DG magnitude} and {GE magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, and the square on {DG magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {GE magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({DG magnitude}), and the greater (term) {DG magnitude} is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) {DC line} [Def. 10.5].\nThus, {DF magnitude} is also commensurable in length with {DG magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nThe remainder {GF magnitude} is thus commensurable in length with {DF magnitude} [Prop. 10.15].\n[Therefore, since {DF magnitude} is commensurable with {GF magnitude}, and {DF magnitude} is rational, {GF magnitude} is thus also rational.\nTherefore, since {DF magnitude} is commensurable in length with {GF magnitude},] {DF magnitude} (is) incommensurable in length with {EF magnitude}.\nThus, {FG magnitude} is also incommensurable in length with {EF magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].\n{GF magnitude} and {FE magnitude} [are] thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nThus, {EG magnitude} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].\nBut, (it is) also rational.\nThe very thing is impossible.\n\nThus, an apotome is not the same as a binomial.\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n\n[Corollary]\n\nThe apotome and the irrational (straight-lines) after it are neither the same as a medial (straight-line) nor (the same) as one another.\n\nFor the (square) on a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a rational (straight-line which is) incommensurable in length with the (straight-line) to which (the area) is applied [Prop. 10.22].\nAnd the (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a first apotome [Prop. 10.97].\nAnd the (square) on a first apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a second apotome [Prop. 10.98].\nAnd the (square) on a second apotome of a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a third apotome [Prop. 10.99].\nAnd (square) on a minor (straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a fourth apotome [Prop. 10.100].\nAnd (square) on that (straight-line) which with a rational (area) produces a medial whole, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a fifth apotome [Prop. 10.101].\nAnd (square) on that (straight-line) which with a medial (area) produces a medial whole, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a sixth apotome [Prop. 10.102].\nTherefore, since the aforementioned breadths differ from the first (breadth), and from one another---from the first, because it is rational, and from one another since they are not the same in order---clearly, the irrational (straight-lines) themselves also differ from one another.\nAnd since it has been shown that an apotome is not the same as a binomial [Prop. 10.111], and (that) the (irrational straight-lines) after the apotome, being applied to a rational (straight-line), produce as breadth, each according to its own (order), apotomes, and (that) the (irrational straight-lines) after the binomial themselves also (produce as breadth), according (to their) order, binomials, the (irrational straight-lines) after the apotome are thus different, and the (irrational straight-lines) after the binomial (are also) different, so that there are, in order, 13 irrational (straight-lines) in all:\nMedial,\nBinomial,\nFirst bimedial,\nSecond bimedial,\nMajor,\nSquare-root of a rational plus a medial (area),\nSquare-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas),\nApotome,\nFirst apotome of a medial,\nSecond apotome of a medial,\nMinor,\nThat which with a rational (area) produces a medial whole,\nThat which with a medial (area) produces a medial whole.\n",

    "prose": "The (square) on a rational (straight-line), applied to a binomial (straight-line), produces as breadth an apotome whose terms are commensurable (in length) with the terms of the binomial, and, furthermore, in the same ratio.\nMoreover, the created apotome will have the same order as the binomial.\n\nLet {A magnitude} be a rational (straight-line), and {BC magnitude} a binomial (straight-line), of which let {DC magnitude} be the greater term.\nAnd let the (rectangle contained) by {BC magnitude} and {EF magnitude} be equal to the (square) on {A magnitude}.\nI say that {EF magnitude} is an apotome whose terms are commensurable (in length) with {CD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}, and in the same ratio, and, moreover, that {EF magnitude} will have the same order as {BC magnitude}.\n\nFor, again, let the (rectangle contained) by {BD magnitude} and {G magnitude} be equal to the (square) on {A magnitude}.\nTherefore, since the (rectangle contained) by {BC magnitude} and {EF magnitude} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {BD magnitude} and {G magnitude}, thus as {CB magnitude} is to {BD magnitude}, so {G magnitude} (is) to {EF magnitude} [Prop. 6.16].\nAnd {CB magnitude} (is) greater than {BD magnitude}.\nThus, {G magnitude} is also greater than {EF magnitude} [Props. 5.16, 5.14].\nLet {EH magnitude} be equal to {G magnitude}.\nThus, as {CB magnitude} is to {BD magnitude}, so {HE magnitude} (is) to {EF magnitude}.\nThus, via separation, as {CD magnitude} is to {BD magnitude}, so {HF magnitude} (is) to {FE magnitude} [Prop. 5.17].\nLet it have been contrived that as {HF magnitude} (is) to {FE magnitude}, so {FK magnitude} (is) to {KE magnitude}.\nAnd, thus, the whole {HK magnitude} is to the whole {KF magnitude}, as {FK magnitude} (is) to {KE magnitude}.\nFor as one of the leading (proportional magnitudes is) to one of the following, so all of the leading (magnitudes) are to all of the following [Prop. 5.12].\nAnd as {FK magnitude} (is) to {KE magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} is to {DB magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].\nAnd, thus, as {HK magnitude} (is) to {KF magnitude}, so {CD magnitude} is to {DB magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].\nAnd the (square) on {CD magnitude} (is) commensurable with the (square) on {DB magnitude} [Prop. 10.36].\nThe (square) on {HK magnitude} is thus also commensurable with the (square) on {KF magnitude} [Props. 6.22, 10.11].\nAnd as the (square) on {HK magnitude} is to the (square) on {KF magnitude}, so {HK magnitude} (is) to {KE magnitude}, since the three (straight-lines) {HK magnitude}, {KF magnitude}, and {KE magnitude} are proportional [Def. 5.9].\n{HK magnitude} is thus commensurable in length with {KE magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].\nHence, {HE magnitude} is also commensurable in length with {EK magnitude} [Prop. 10.15].\nAnd since the (square) on {A magnitude} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {EH magnitude} and {BD magnitude}, and the (square) on {A magnitude} is rational, the (rectangle contained) by {EH magnitude} and {BD magnitude} is thus also rational.\nAnd it is applied to the rational (straight-line) {BD magnitude}.\nThus, {EH magnitude} is rational, and commensurable in length with {BD magnitude} [Prop. 10.20].\nAnd, hence, the (straight-line) commensurable (in length) with it, {EK magnitude}, is also rational [Def. 10.3], and commensurable in length with {BD magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nTherefore, since as {CD magnitude} is to {DB magnitude}, so {FK magnitude} (is) to {KE magnitude}, and {CD magnitude} and {DB magnitude} are (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only, {FK magnitude} and {KE magnitude} are also commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].\nAnd {KE magnitude} is rational.\nThus, {FK magnitude} is also rational.\n{FK magnitude} and {KE magnitude} are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\nThus, {EF magnitude} is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].\n\nAnd the square on {CD magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {DB magnitude} either by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable, or by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable, (in length) with ({CD magnitude}).\n\nTherefore, if the square on {CD magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {DB magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with [{CD magnitude}] then the square on {FK magnitude} will also be greater than (the square on) {KE magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({FK magnitude}) [Prop. 10.14].\nAnd if {CD magnitude} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) {FK magnitude} [Props. 10.11, 10.12].\nAnd if {BD magnitude} (is commensurable), (so) also (is) {KE magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd if neither of {CD magnitude} or {DB magnitude} (is commensurable), neither also (are) either of {FK magnitude} or {KE magnitude}.\n\nAnd if the square on {CD magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {DB magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({CD magnitude}) then the square on {FK magnitude} will also be greater than (the square on) {KE magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({FK magnitude}) [Prop. 10.14].\nAnd if {CD magnitude} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) {FK magnitude} [Props. 10.11, 10.12].\nAnd if {BD magnitude} (is commensurable), (so) also (is) {KE magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd if neither of {CD magnitude} or {DB magnitude} (is commensurable), neither also (are) either of {FK magnitude} or {KE magnitude}.\nHence, {FE magnitude} is an apotome whose terms, {FK magnitude} and {KE magnitude}, are commensurable (in length) with the terms, {CD magnitude} and {DB magnitude}, of the binomial, and in the same ratio.\nAnd ({FE magnitude}) has the same order as {BC magnitude} [Defs. 10.5-10.10].\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",

magnitude} and {KH magnitude} be equal to the (square) on {A magnitude}, such that the square on the rational (straight-line) {A magnitude}, applied to the apotome {BD magnitude}, produces {KH magnitude} as breadth.\nI say that {KH magnitude} is a binomial whose terms are commensurable with the terms of {BD magnitude}, and in the same ratio, and, moreover, that {KH magnitude} has the same order as {BD magnitude}.\n\nFor let {DC magnitude} be an attachment to {BD magnitude}.\nThus, {BC magnitude} and {CD magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].\nAnd let the (rectangle contained) by {BC magnitude} and {G magnitude} also be equal to the (square) on {A magnitude}.\nAnd the (square) on {A magnitude} (is) rational.\nThe (rectangle contained) by {BC magnitude} and {G magnitude} (is) thus also rational.\nAnd it has been applied to the rational (straight-line) {BC magnitude}.\nThus, {G magnitude} is rational, and commensurable in length with {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.20].\nTherefore, since the (rectangle contained) by {BC magnitude} and {G magnitude} is equal to the (rectangle contained) by {BD magnitude} and {KH magnitude}, thus, proportionally, as {CB magnitude} is to {BD magnitude}, so {KH magnitude} (is) to {G magnitude} [Prop. 6.16].\nAnd {BC magnitude} (is) greater than {BD magnitude}.\nThus, {KH magnitude} (is) also greater than {G magnitude} [Prop. 5.16, 5.14].\nLet {KE magnitude} be made equal to {G magnitude}.\n{KE magnitude} is thus commensurable in length with {BC magnitude}.\nAnd since as {CB magnitude} is to {BD magnitude}, so {HK magnitude} (is) to {KE magnitude}, thus, via conversion, as {BC magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude}, so {KH magnitude} (is) to {HE magnitude} [Prop. 5.19 corr.].\nLet it have been contrived that as {KH magnitude} (is) to {HE magnitude}, so {HF magnitude} (is) to {FE magnitude}.\nAnd thus the remainder {KF magnitude} is to {FH magnitude}, as {KH magnitude} (is) to {HE magnitude}---that is to say, [as] {BC magnitude} (is) to {CD magnitude} [Prop. 5.19].\nAnd {BC magnitude} and {CD magnitude} [are] commensurable in square only.\n\n{KF magnitude} and {FH magnitude} are thus also commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.11].\nAnd since as {KH magnitude} is to {HE magnitude}, (so) {KF magnitude} (is) to {FH magnitude}, but as {KH magnitude} (is) to {HE magnitude}, (so) {HF magnitude} (is) to {FE magnitude}, thus, also as {KF magnitude} (is) to {FH magnitude}, (so) {HF magnitude} (is) to {FE magnitude} [Prop. 5.11].\nAnd hence as the first (is) to the third, so the (square) on the first (is) to the (square) on the second [Def. 5.9].\nAnd thus as {KF magnitude} (is) to {FE magnitude}, so the (square) on {KF magnitude} (is) to the (square) on {FH magnitude}.\nAnd the (square) on {KF magnitude} is commensurable with the (square) on {FH magnitude}.\nFor {KF magnitude} and {FH magnitude} are commensurable in square.\nThus, {KF magnitude} is also commensurable in length with {FE magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].\nHence, {KF magnitude} [is] also commensurable in length with {KE magnitude} [Prop. 10.15].\nAnd {KE magnitude} is rational, and commensurable in length with {BC magnitude}.\nThus, {KF magnitude} (is) also rational, and commensurable in length with {BC magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd since as {BC magnitude} is to {CD magnitude}, (so) {KF magnitude} (is) to {FH magnitude}, alternately, as {BC magnitude} (is) to {KF magnitude}, so {DC magnitude} (is) to {FH magnitude} [Prop. 5.16].\nAnd {BC magnitude} (is) commensurable (in length) with {KF magnitude}.\nThus, {FH magnitude} (is) also commensurable in length with {CD magnitude} [Prop. 10.11].\nAnd {BC magnitude} and {CD magnitude} are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.\n{KF magnitude} and {FH magnitude} are thus also rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only [Def. 10.3, Prop. 10.13].\nThus, {KH magnitude} is a binomial [Prop. 10.36].\n\nTherefore, if the square on {BC magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {CD magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({BC magnitude}), then the square on {KF magnitude} will also be greater than (the square on) {FH magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with ({KF magnitude}) [Prop. 10.14].\nAnd if {BC magnitude} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) {KF magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd if {CD magnitude} is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) {FH magnitude} [Prop. 10.12].\nAnd if neither of {BC magnitude} or {CD magnitude} (are commensurable), neither also (are) either of {KF magnitude} or {FH magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].\n\nAnd if the square on {BC magnitude} is greater than (the square on) {CD magnitude} by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with ({BC magnitude}) then the square on {KF magnitude} will also be greater than (the square on) {FH magnitude} by the (square) on (some

also (are) either of {KF magnitude} or {FH magnitude} [Prop. 10.13].\n\n{KH magnitude} is thus a binomial whose terms, {KF magnitude} and {FH magnitude}, [are] commensurable (in length) with the terms, {BC magnitude} and {CD magnitude}, of the apotome, and in the same ratio.\nMoreover, {KH magnitude} will have the same order as {BC magnitude} [Defs. 10.5-10.10].\n(Which is) the very thing it
