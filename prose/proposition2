To place a straight-line equal to a given straight-line at a given point.

Let {A point} be the given point, and {BC line} the given straight-line.
So it is required to place a straight-line at point {A point} equal to the given straight-line {BC line}.

For let the straight-line {AB line} have been joined from point {A point} to point {B point} [Post. 1], and let the equilateral triangle {DAB polygon} have been been constructed upon it [Prop. 1.1].
And let the straight-lines {AE line} and {BF line} have been produced in a straight-line with {DA line} and {DB line} (respectively) [Post. 2].
And let the circle {CGH circle B} with center {B point} and radius {BC line} have been drawn [Post. 3],
and again let the circle {GKL circle D} with center {D point} and radius {DG line} have been drawn [Post. 3].

Therefore, since the point {B point} is the center of (the circle) {CGH circle B}, {BC line} is equal to {BG line} [Def. 1.15].
Again, since the point {D point} is the center of the circle {GKL circle D}, {DL line} is equal to {DG line} [Def. 1.15].
And within these, {DA line} is equal to {DB line}.
Thus, the remainder {AL line} is equal to the remainder {BG line} [C.N. 3].
But {BC line} was also shown (to be) equal to {BG line}.
Thus, {AL line} and {BC line} are each equal to {BG line}.
But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N. 1]. Thus, {AL line} is also equal to {BC line}.

Thus, the straight-line {AL line}, equal to the given straight-line {BC line}, has been placed at the given point {A point}. (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
