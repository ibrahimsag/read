If there are any number of magnitudes whatsoever (which are) equal multiples, respectively, of some (other) magnitudes, of equal number (to them), then as many times as one of the (first) magnitudes is (divisible) by one (of the second), so many times will all (of the first magnitudes) also (be divisible) by all (of the second).

Let there be any number of magnitudes whatsoever, AB, CD, (which are) equal multiples, respectively, of some (other) magnitudes, E, F, of equal number (to them).
I say that as many times as AB is (divisible) by E, so many times will AB, CD also be (divisible) by E, F.

For since AB, CD are equal multiples of E, F, thus as many magnitudes as (there) are in AB equal to E, so many (are there) also in CD equal to F.
Let AB have been divided into magnitudes AG, GB, equal to E, and CD into (magnitudes) CH, HD, equal to F.
So, the number of (divisions) AG, GB will be equal to the number of (divisions) CH, HD.
And since AG is equal to E, and CH to F, AG (is) thus equal to E, and AG, CH to E, F.
So, for the same (reasons), GB is equal to E, and GB, HD to E, F.
Thus, as many (magnitudes) as (there) are in AB equal to E, so many (are there) also in AB, CD equal to E, F.
Thus, as many times as AB is (divisible) by E, so many times will AB, CD also be (divisible) by E, F.

Thus, if there are any number of magnitudes whatsoever (which are) equal multiples, respectively, of some (other) magnitudes, of equal number (to them), then as many times as one of the (first) magnitudes is (divisible) by one (of the second), so many times will all (of the first magnitudes) also (be divisible) by all (of the second).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
