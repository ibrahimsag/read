If a straight-line falling across two straight-lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another then the (two) straight-lines will be parallel to one another.

For let the straight-line {EF line}, falling across the two straight-lines {AB line} and {CD line}, make the alternate angles {AEF angle} and {EFD angle} equal to one another.
I say that {AB line} and CD are parallel.

For if not, being produced, {AB line} and {CD line} will certainly meet together: either in the direction of {B point} and {D point}, or (in the direction) of {A point} and {C point} [Def. 1.23].
Let them have been produced, and let them meet together in the direction of {B point} and {D point} at (point) {G point}.
So, for the triangle {GEF given}, the external angle {AEF angle} is equal to the interior and opposite (angle) {EFG given}.
The very thing is impossible [Prop. 1.16].
Thus, being produced, {AB line} and {DC line} will not meet together in the direction of {B point} and {D point}.
Similarly, it can be shown that neither (will they meet together) in (the direction of) {A point} and {C point}.
But (straight-lines) meeting in neither direction are parallel [Def. 1.23].
Thus, {AB line} and {CD line} are parallel.

Thus, if a straight-line falling across two straight-lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another then the (two) straight-lines will be parallel (to one another).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
